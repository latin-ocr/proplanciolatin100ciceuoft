et erat quaedam earum res publica neque tamen magistratus suos habe·

Ramsay R. Ant. p. 92 fs.—At1nat1] Atina was situated in the far SUE
os Latium in the Sabine Hills between Venafrum and Sora. It was a
very ancient and powerful city3 hence Martial in an epigram on Marius
one of its inhabitants (Atinas) says silari, quietae cultor et comae vitae,
quo cive prisca gloriatur Atina and Vergil Aen. V11 630 calls it
Atina potens. Silius Italicus (VIII 398 monte nivoso descendens
Atina) speaks of its cold and elevated position, a feature which the
modern city of Atina retains. Though originally reduced to the con-
dition of a praefectura, it became subsequently a municiputm cum

⁸ suffragio, and continued to be a considerable place under the Roman

vnpire. It miras included in the tribus Teretina. Smith Dict. Geogr.
o . 1 p. 310 .

1. 19. non tam suburbana] ‘not situated so near the city.’ Tus-
culum was only abont 12 miles from Rome. '

1. 20. quantum interesse vis] ‘how much disterence wlil you nave
it that it makes?' §84 me vult ficisse Rhodi, or. p. Cael. §53 si tam
familiaris erat Clodiae quam tu esse vis.——ad rationem petendi] ‘in
respect of the prosecution of a canvass‚' Zumpt Gr. ἓ 296.

1. 21. utrum magis favere putas—suis ?] ait Tusculanos minus
esse suffragatos municipibus suis, velut iampridem huiusmodi dignitate
saturatos3 istos vero, qui Atinate oppido venirent, exoptasse ornari
Plancium, quod ea res non minus etiam ad honorem suum pertineret,
cum paucissimos de suis civibus haberent senatoriis magistratibus hono-
ratos. Praeterea et hinc istis civitatibus adicit differentiam, quod
Atinates semper civibus suis faverant3 Tusculani plurimum livoris
naturaliter etiam circa municipes suos habuisse videntur. Sic et M. Cato
ille censorius pro maligno et invido habitus est. Nec aliter etiam
Lucilius de eorundem moribus sentit hoc dicens: prima Papiria tu
solidarum. SCHOL. VATICANA‚ where for the last two words Wunder
suggests Tuscolz‘damm.

1. 22. alteri] the people of Atina, which was not far from Arpinum,
Cicero’s birthplace‚ ἕ 22 1. 20 sumus enim finitimi A ti nati bus.

1. 23. huius] Cn. Saturninus appeared in court as an advocatus
of Plancius, that he might by his interest and sympathy with him pre-
dispose the judges in his friend's favour, ἓ 29.

1. 26. sellam curulem] by synecdoche sor ‘honorem curulem,’ ‘a
curule office' or ‘dignity.’ The sella emulis was a folding-stool with
curved legs placed cross-wise, introduced from Etruria. The use of the
sella curulis, originally the exclusive privilege of kings, was afterwards
conferred upon consuls, praetors, curule aediles, also upon the dictator
and his magister equitum, the decemviri; and at a later period it was
extended to the quaestor. These high offices of state were hence 'called
magistratus curules. The sella( was of ivory or inlaid with ivory;
hence Horace Epist. 1 6, 58 speaks of curule ebur for curulis sella.
