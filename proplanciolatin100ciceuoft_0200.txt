132 PRO CN. PLANCIO [XXII §54-

Ι nesses more in number than the votes which be got in that tribus. He
j could not mean to say that those who voted sor him were bribed, but if
ί the tribe was bribed, he must, as Cic. says, either be producing some
l, men as witnesses who for a bribe had voted against him, or if they were
x‘not bribed by another, they must have been bribed by himself, sor the
&tribe was bribed ' (Long). Wunder takes Cicero's meaning to be ε the
2 l testimony of the witnesses whom Laterensis brings forward from the
'i Voltinia tribus is inadmissible. For either they were bribed by Plancius

not to vote for Laterensis, in which case they cannot be witnesses, since

f] they were bribed; or else in their disinterested zeal without being bribed
² they voted for Plancius rather than Laterensis, in which case it is not
likely that they will appear as witnesses against Plancius, unless Late·

tensis has bribed them to do so

CHAPTER XXIII

§ ⁵5, 1. 22. 111 circo Flaminio] the circus which was constructed
before the Second Punic War by the censor C. Flaminius Nepos,
who fell at the battle of Trasimenus, in the year 220 B.C.‚ the same who
constructed the great northern mad, named after him the via Flaminia.
It was in the campus Flaminius or prata Flaminia, where the ludi
Taurii and Apollinares were frequently held, and the people and senate
sometimes assembled when it was necessary to convene them outside the
walls. It was situated in the district which lies between the southern
part of the Via Lata or the modern Corso‚ and the Tiber, not far from
the Capitol. It is by some misplaced in the modern Piazza Navona.
See Burn’s Rome and the Campagna p. 313, Ramsay R. A. p. 43.

1. 23. calu-tt. re recenti, nunc in causa refrixit] ‘ was much
talked of, carried on warmly, when the matter was fresh, but now during
the trial it has lost its inteiest,’ lit. ‘has cooled down‚’ (‘n0n amplius
pro vero crimine habetur.' W.) Cf. ep. ad Att. IV 16, 11 (18 3 ed.
Wesenberg) iudicia calent, or. Phil. v§ 11 calebant in interiore

gescere or. Phil. v ξ 3ορείίὶ apparatus refrigescent, ep. ad Att. 1 1 ἓ 2
cum Romaea iudiciis forum refrixerit, ¹9 ἓ 4 lzaec tota res interpellata
bello refrixerat, ad Qu, fr. 111. 2 ἓ 3 Scaurus refrixerat, i.e. ‘had
ceased to give interest' not, as Lewis and Short translate, ‘ had given up,'
ad div. 11 ἓ 81 ceteris in locis sortes plane refrixerunt, i, e. ‘ have gone
quite out of fashion‚' ep. ad Att. 11 ι §6 quod de agraria lege quaeris,
videtur iam refrixisse, ‘ to have hung fire.' See more exx. in N agelsb.
lat. St. p. 385 f. As to the charge referred to, it would seem that some
money was found in the F laminian circus, which, in the absence of a .
claimant, was suspected to have been intended for the bribed voters.

1. 24. nec quae tribus] ‘nor the tribe for whom the money was
intended.’ On divisor see ἓ 48 l. 14.
