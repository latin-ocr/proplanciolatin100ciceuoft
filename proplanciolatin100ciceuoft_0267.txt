toni) when Tubero came to him, Quintus frater cum ex A sia decessisset
ante Kal. Maias et Athenas venisset Idibus Maiis ep. ad Att. 111 9.

mained there with Plancius, though he was uncomfortable and con-
stantly thinking about leaving it for Epirus or Cyzicus (ep. ad Att. 111
14, 2 ego propter viae celebritatem et quotidianam expectationem rerum

non a Pla acio—nam is quidem retinet—verum ab ipso loco minime ap·
posito ad tolerandam in tanto luctu calamitatem, cf. ib. 15 ξ 6, 16) until
he finally decided Sept. 16th to visit Atticus in Epirus, 19 ἓ 1. Still he
did not leave Plancius until Nov. 13th‚ when he suddenly returned to
Dyrrhachium, which he reached before the 26th, when he sent a letter to
Atticus (ΙΙΙ 22), partly written at Thessalonica. Me adlcuc Plancius

magno lzonori sperat sore ; sed iam, cum adventare milites dicentur,
faciendum nobis erit, ut ab eo discedamus. So he writes to his family
