'not sor offences specially against the lex Licinia de sodaliciis
but for ordinary ambitus114. The possibility of such a mistake
being made indicates a certain relation between crimina am-
bitus and sodaliciorum, though their diversity appears from
this oration no less than from the fact that the tribunals for
trying the two offences were distinct, that the same person ᾗ
could be tried for each separately115, and lastly that, whereas 2
unsuccessful candidates could be punished for ambitusssss, for Ι
sodalicia only those actually elected were punishable. s

§20. The question, then, is what was the essential import
of sodalicia and what its affinity with and distinction from
ordinary ambitus.

The right of combination in common pursuance of common
aims was not restricted in Roman law. There was no enact-
ment abolishing this right in a general way, for the laws
usually cited to prove the contrary apply to nightly assemblages
and gatherings, to popular meetings not presided over by a
magistrate, or to specially-named unions, as the law against
the Bacchanalia: indeed the xii tables contained, according to
Gaius, a clause permitting assemblages in cases where no
existing decree was infringed by them. Thus arose the sodali· ¹
tates, the collegia and the sodalicia, for whose members the
general term sodales was in use, although the objects of the
several associations were essentially different.
