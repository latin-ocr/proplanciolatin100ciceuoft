ludos vero nonfacere, quid foedius? Liv. XXXI 4, 5 ludi Romani
scenici magnifice apparateque facti. Praeneste, now Pale-strina, was
the great sortress-town on the Aequian frontier, commanding the pas-
sage from Latium into the valley of the Sacco, situated on one of the
projecting spurs of the mountains lying between that river and the Anio
(altum Praeneste Verg. Aen. V11 682). It possessed a very ancient
temple of Fortune, which was restored by Sulla. It was a favourite
resort of the Romans on account os its healthy situation (Hor. Od. 111
4, 23). See Burn’s Rome and the Campagna p. 382 ff,

1.11. quid? am quaestores nonne fecerunt Ἰ] i. q. omiserunt
facere. Ernesti and Wunder are wrong in reading non from one
inferior MS, because nonne is found in several other places, where we
should expect to find non, the rule being that ‘by a question with
nonne a certainty is expressed that a thing is, with non surprise that it
is not and a doubt of the possibility of its being denied’ Madv. Gr.

Cyrenis] where Laterensis was pro-quaestor in the year of Cicero’s
consulship B.C. 63. See Intr. ἓ 6 and cf. §13- Cyrene, or Cyrenae,
the chief city of Cyrenaica and the most famous of the H ellenic colonies
in Africa, was founded in B.C. 631 by Battus over a spring Cyre, conse-
crated to Apollo. Among its celebrated natives were Aristippus the
philosopher, the poet Callimachus, and the orator Synesius bishop of·
Apollonia. Monarchical rule prevailed there, long aster it was super-
seded by republicanism in other Greek colonies.

1. 13. ita multa—geruntur] ita is here explanatory and to be taken
with geruntur, not with multa, ‘ much goes on at Rome in such a
manner that what goes on in the provinces is scarcely heard of.’
