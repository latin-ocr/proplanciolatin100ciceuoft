were to try the case. In trials under all other laws, the jury was chosen
by lot from all the tribes, and both prosecutor and defi’ndant were allowed
to challenge them (reicere). The senate in conjerring this exceptional
power on the prosecutor supposed that he wozlld be ll‘leely to name the tribes
which the accused was suspected of having corrupted, in which case the
same parties would be both witnesses and jury. Now if the clcy‘endant’s
own tribe or a tribe with which he was closely connected, was chosen
as one of the tribes to select the yury from, the defendant could not objecnt
But Laterensis, contrary to the i'ntentzon of the senate m passing the law,
ded not choose the tribes with which Plancius had i'ntzmate relations au ’l
which he charged him with corruptmg‚ but others wulz which he had no
connexion whatever. What reasonable infe7ence may be drawn from
this? either that Laterensis was guilty of such severi,ty as was not
contemplated by the law, or else that he dzd not believe that the two
tribes, which he declmed to name, had been corrupted by Planczfflus
Plancius did much to merit the effction of his sellow- tribesmen. He
helped them in d fficulttes and got places for manv os thern ίΙιιοιισΙι his
sather’s i:nfluence and surely it was never intended that the leges (le
ambitu should put a stop to all those ordinar ν arts and expedients
by which popularity and influence is seem ed in a man 's own tribe.
Let Laterensis but prove his case that Plancius corrupted the tribes by
means of sodalicia, and then I shall wonder why he did not use
the weapons provided for him by the lex Licinia, why he did not nanze
Plancius' own tribe and any other which he charges him with having»
bribed. Plancius can show how he got the votes of the tribes which
voted for him quite as easily as Laterensis can show how he himself
got the votes of any of them (ξ 36—43).
