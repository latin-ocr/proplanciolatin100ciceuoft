¹24 PRO CN. PLANCIO [XX155‘2

1. 11. 1.. Phfflppus] Lucius Marcius Philippus Q.f. Q. n. was
tribune of the plebs B.C. 103, in which year he brought forward a law
chiefly memorable for his statement that there were not 2000 men of
property in the state (de off. 11 ξ 73 where see my note). In B.C. 100
he was one of those who took up arms against Saturninus. He was a
candidate for the consulship B.C. 93 but defeated by Herennius (Brut.
ἓ 166, or. p. Mur. ἓ 36), consul B.C. 91 with Sextus Julius Caesar, when
he distinguished himself by his opposition to the measures of the tri-
bune M. Livius Drusus (above ξ 33, de legg. II ξ 31, or. p. dom.§
41, ξ 50), censor 13.C. 86 with M. Perperna. Cicero speaks very highly
of him in several passages, or. p. Mur. ἓ 36, p. Quinct. ἓ 72, Brut. ἓ 173
where as a speaker he is said to have summa libertas, multae facetiae,
and to be satis creber in reperiendis, solutus in explicandis sententiis
(see n. on de off. 15 108). He is the same as the Philippus of whom
Horace (Ep. I 7, 46) tells the well-known anecdote. ’

summa nobil-itate] Fabri on Livy XXI 1, 4 gives several instances
in which the genitive of quality accompanies a Proper Name enthetically
without an appellative (Kenn. Gr. p. 415), Liv. XXII 60, 5 T. Manlius
Torquatus priscae ac nimis durae severitatis, XXX 4, 13 7, 26, XLII
55,1. The following are instances where the ablatIve is so used,

1.12.c.cae11us] Gaius Caelius Caldus was consul B..C 94
with L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, being the first of his family to obtain
any curule office (or. p. Mur. ἕ 17, Verr. V§ 180). He was tribune of
the plebs 13.C. 107, when he proposed a lex tabellaria, which provided
that in the courts of justice voting by ballot should apply to cases of
high treason also (perduellio), hitherto excepted from the operation of
the lex Cassia Β. C. 137 (Plin. ep. III 20). In the civil war Β. C. 83 he
was a supporter of Marius. Q. Cic. de pet. cons. ξ 11 quanto melior
tibi fortuna peti'tzonis data est quam nuper homini novo C. Caelio. '
Ille cum duobus hominibus zta nobilissimis petebat, ut tamen in eis
omnia pluris essent quam ipsa nobilztas.. ‚Ac tamen eorum alterum-
Ca elz us, cum multo insertor esset genere, superior nulla re paene,
superavit. As a speaker, he did not rise above mediocrity, Brut.

1.13.< Rufus] P. Rutilius Sp. f. Sp. n. Rufus (de off. 11
ἓ 47), famous as soldier, orator and man of letters, was consul in
B,- C. 105 ,and m B. C. 99 legatus under Q. Mucius Scaevola when pro-
consul o'f Asia. While acting in this capacity, by repressing the illegal
extortions of the tax· collectors (publicani) he incurred the hatred of the
equestrian body. Accordingly on his return to Rome he was unjustly
arraigned of malversation (de repetundis», found guilty and compelled to
withdraw into banishment in Β. C. 92 (Athenaeus Iv. p. 168 Α παρὰ δὲ
