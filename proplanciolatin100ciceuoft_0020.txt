(b) T he defendant Gnaeus Plancius

§4 Cn. Plancius carne of a plebeian family of eques-
trian rank28, and was born at Atina29, an ancient city in the

Sabine hills not far east of Arpinum, which was first a prae-
fectura governed by magistrates from Rome and subsequently
obtained the civitas cum suffragio. His father Gnaeus
Plancius was a highly respectable and influential burgess in
his municzffiium, a member of the society of publicani and
a founder as well as manager or director of several* of their
companies³⁰ for farming the taxes, and was frequently em—
ployed as arbiter and counsellor in mercantile enterprises. In
his younger years Plancius the elder had served in the army
of P. Crassus31, who was consul in Β. C. 97 and who in B. C. 93
celebrated a triumph over the Lusitanians. At a later period of
his life he incurred the displeasure of the optimate party
because of his vehemence in demanding an abatement of the
, terms of a contract concluded unreservedly by a company of
publicani in Asia for the farming of the provincial impost's.
ἱ In Β. C. 61 this company, which of course belonged to the ordo

equester, complained to the senate that they had offered too
much and asked for a reduction of the sum because of the

straits to which Asia was reduced by the war and of the impossi-
bility of collecting the taxes from the already oppressed provin-
cials. C. Julius Caesar supported their prayer, while M. Cato,
who thought that they ought to be kept to the bargaini which
they had made in their excessive eagerness‚ exerted himself to the
utmost against them and by his speeches so protracted the
session that there was no time for a division. And so the
matter was postponed, and perhaps might not have been
