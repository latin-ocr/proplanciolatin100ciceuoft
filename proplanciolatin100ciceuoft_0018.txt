xiv INTROD UCTION

that the consecration was illegal and that the area might
without prejudice to religion be restored to Cicero. This
judgment reeeived the support of nearly all the members of
the senate, and a resolution was carried, notwithstanding the
vehement opposition of ClodiuS‚ for the restoration of Cicero's
house and sor the payment of two million sesterces to re-
build it.

Rome was meanwhile disturbed by the riots of Clodius,
who looked forward to obtaining the aedileship and thus es-
caping the punishment due to his lawless acts. In spite of the
attempts of Milo, as tribune, to hinder the comitia sor the
election of aediles and of the proposal of L. Racilius20 for a
legal inquiry into his conduct, Clodius was chosen curule
aedile next year on the 22nd of January. The first thing he did
was to commence a prosecution against Milo which, however,
he was forced to drop. He then instigated M. Tullius Albino-
vanus to charge P. Sestius, the late tribune, with a breach
of the peace. One of Cicero's most important orations was
in desence of his friend and supporter‚ who was acquitted by
the votes of all the jurymen21 on the 13th of March. Before
this, on the 11th of February, in a speech no longer extant
he had defended L. Bestia on a charge of bribery· in his
suit for the Praetorship. . He was more fortunate in his desence
of M. Caelius, charged with an intention to assassinate the
Alexandrian envoy Dio and to poison22 Clodia. Lastly‚ he
delivered his great speech de provinciis consularibus, in which
he urged the recall of the ex-consuls Piso and Gabinius from
their respective provinces Syria and Macedonia on account of
their bad administration2³‚ but spoke against the proposal to
recall Caesar at the end of the first five years of his Gallie corn-
mand‚ thus publicly ratifying his submission to the triumvirs.
