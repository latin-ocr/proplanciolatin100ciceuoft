¹ curules. Fieri tamen poterat, et ut plures quam duo peterent, et ut

plures etiam pares suffragiis essent. Quod si accideret, constitutum est
a maioribus, ut sortirentur, quinam ex iis aedilitatem gererent. Sin
‘ autem soli duo totidem suffragia tulissent, sortitio locum non habebat.

MAN UTIUS

ἓ ⁵4, 1. 7. et als] the third argument of Laterensis, by which he
really accuses himself of an intended coitio.

Aniensem] the tribus of Plotius, as the Teretina was that of
Plancius, ξ 21 1. 15,§ 381. 1.

1. 9. ab utroque] i.e. by Plotius and Plancius, the former of
whom did not help Pedius nor the latter Laterensis at the second
election with their respective tribus, sor they seared they might want the ”

votes of these tribus themselves.

ne in angustum venirent] ‘lest they (Plotius and Plancius) should
be reduced to a strait, be placed in an awkward position ;' i.e. by losing
the necessary votes of those tribus themselves. ‘Ipsius Laterensis
haec verba fuisse, quibus significaverit ne necessariis suffragiis ipsi pri-
varentur, ex sequentibus intellegitur, in quibus Cicero ridiculum hoc
loquendi genus reddit.’ WUNDER. Angustum is used substantively as
in de off. 1 ἓ 53, de am. § 20, acad. 1§ 38 cum eas (perturbationes)
contraherent in angustumque deducerent, Liv. XXVII 46, 2 coartatio
plurimorum in angusto tendentium, Ter. Haut. 1V 2, 2 (l. 669) in

angustum nunc meae coguntur copiae.

quam convenit] ironically‚ ‘ how is it consistent‚’ so that there is no
need to say that quam is for quam non or quam parum, cf. or. p. Sull.
ἓ 33 attende, quam ego defugiam auctoritatem consulatus mei, ‘ hoW, i. e.
how little, I disavow the acts of my consulship,' auct. ad Heren. IV ἕ 20
videte ergo qua m convenia t eos impetrare.

1. 10. nondum cognita populi voluflate] superioribus comitiis,
cum Plotius et Plancius de populi erga se voluntate, quam postea latis
suffragiis cognoverant, certi nihil scirent. MANUTIUS

iam tum] i.e. nondum cognita populi voluntate. Before
the first election Plancius and Plotius could not know the feeling os
the people about them, Cicero therefore argues that there is no con-
sistency in the assertion that Pedius and Plancius, who were according
to Laterensis then in coalition (coniunctos), should have generously
sacrificed their own tribus to help him (Lat.)‚ when the result was
uncertain, and yet should refuse to do so when they knew they must be
secure for the next election.

1. 11. suarum tribuum] in quibus censentur. Quo=ut eo.

1. 13. restrictos et tenacis] ‘niggardly and stingy,' perhaps with
a reference to the words of Laterensis ne in angustum venirent. On
the meaning of restrictus see n. to de off. 11 ξ 63 l. 14, and for tenax cf.
or. p. Cael.§ 36 filium familias patre parco ac tenaci, Plaut. Capt. 11
