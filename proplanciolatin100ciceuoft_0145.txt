1. 5. patrem publicanum] sc. esse. ‘Transitus fit ad quaestiun-
culam, qua humilitas generis obiciebatur Plancio, ut eapropter elargitus
pecuniam videretur, quoniam consequi aedilitatem familiae suae digni-
tate non posset. Publicanorum itaque Tullius ordinem necessario ad·
serit, qui tunc ex equestri ordine accedebant ad vectigalium redemp-
tionem.’ SCHOL. ΑΜΒΚ. The publicani or farmers of the public
revenues (vectzgralia) had become a body of importance as early as the
second Punic War <Liv. XXIII 48, 49), and their numbers, wealth and
influence increased with the extension of the Roman empire and the
increase of its revenue. The societates, or joint stock companies, by
which they were enabled to carry on the undertaking of farming the
revenues of a large province, were composed chiefly of members of the
ordo equestris, who were in reality the class of monied men. In fact,
the Equites, as a body, may be said to have had a monopoly of this
department of mercantile speculati0n3 and in all matters relating to the
collection of the public revenue Equites and Publz'cani became con-
vertible terms. The publicam· were always treated with great respect ;
and by Cicero, who had, however, a special object in view, they are
complimented in the most high-flown language in the present passage.
