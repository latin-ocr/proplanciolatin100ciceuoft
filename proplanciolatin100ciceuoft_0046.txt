xlii INTRODUCTION

Again A. W. Zumpt's¹⁵⁰ hypothesis is, that the law (1)
abolished the appointment of the three decuries of senators,
equites and tribuni aerarii to form one consilium, and em-
powered the praetor urbanus, instead of giving the parties one
such consilium, to propose to them three consilia of jurors, that
there were therefore three judicial collegia, of whom each party
might reject one, so that the third only sat in judgment on the
case ; (2) that the praetors were chosen yearly by lot, as before;
but, as there were causes of minor importance which could not
be determined by any standing commission‚ it had been the
custom for the praetor to receive such complaints and then
nominate by lot a deputy or assistant judge (iudex quaestionis)
to try them. Since the passing of the lex Vatinia each of the
parties to a suit were permitted to challenge the iudex quaes-
tionis nominated at the same time as the three collegia.

ξ 30. The provisions of the lex Aurelia concerning the
composition of the courts in regard to the three decuriae were
not interfered with by the lex Pompeia iudiciaria which was
passed by Pompeius in his second consulship B. C. 55, but the
latter law imposed certain property qualifications on the in-
dividual jurors, in order to maintain the dignity of the courts of
justice and prevent the abuse of the power they possessed for
party purposeS. ’ It was impossible to make any change in the de-
curiae of senators, since probably the tribes were not all repre-
sented in the senate, or, if all, only very unequally ; but Gnaeus
Pompeius went back to an old ordinance for the choice of jurors
for the decuriae of equites and tribuni aerarii according to
tribes (tributim), which was enforced by the lex Sempronia
but afterwards abrogated by Sulla and not revived by L. Aurelius
Cotta. It prescribed that out of each of the 35 tribes an equal
number (from about 10 to 12) of equites and aerarii tribuni
should be enrolled in the annual list of jurors (album iudicum),
divided according to their respective tribes. Thus the number
from 33 tribes would be equal to one decuria of senators. The
35 or 42 taken from 332 tribes would be reduced to 2 5 either
