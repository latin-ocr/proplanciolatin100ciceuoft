C. Julius Caesar Strabo one of the interlocutors in the dialogue de oratore,
cf. de off. 1§ 108, ἓ 133) was consul in 13.C. 90 with P. Rutilius Lupus
when the Social War broke out. (He must not be confounded, as he is
by Appian B. C. 1 40 withSextus Julius Caesar, uncle of the Dictator
who was consul Rc. 91). He carried a law (lex Iulia de civitate sociorum)
which enfranchised all corporate communities in Italy, except those
which had joined in the rebellion‚ provided that they sormally consented
to be incorporated as Romani cives, or. pro Balb. ἕ 21, Aul. Gell. n. a.

1. 7. Gn. Octavii] Gnaeus Octavius, grandson, son and father of
a consul, was himself consul in 13.C. 87 (Brut. ξ 176) with L. Cornelius
Cinna. He was one of the‘staunch supporters of the aristocratical
party, which was perhaps the reason that he failed in obtaining the
aedileship. After Sulla’s departure from Italy to carry on the war
against Mithridates, Cinna tried to obtain the power for the Marian
party by incorporating the new Italian citizens among the thirty-five
tribes, and thus a contest arose between the two consuls, which ended
in the expulsion of Cinna srom the city. But Cinna soon returned with
Marius at the head of an army against the city, which was compelled to
surrender, and Octavius was one of the first victims in the massacres
which followed. This is called the bellum Octavianum, Vell. Pat. 11 20,
