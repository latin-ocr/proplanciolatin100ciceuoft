up as a witness,’ cp. or. p. Rab. Post. ξ 48 possum excitare multos

tentia haec est: Voltiniam tribum dicis a Plancio corruptam, Terc-
tinam habuisse eum venalem. Itaque edere has tribus debuisti, idque
eo magis, quo certius est Plancium, si corrupisset tribus illas, minime
ab iudicibus earum tribuum, hominibus gravissimis et severissimis,
absolutum fore. Verum tua caussa istas tribus non edidisti, quod
praevidebas fore ut iudices ex eis delecti omnes innocentiam rei testa-

suos iudices, sua fretus innocentia duarum illarum tribuum homiuibus

1. 21. quaesitor] The criminal courts of Rome, after their final
organisation by Sulla's lex Cornelia, were named quaestiones perpetuae,
‘ standing commissions of enquiry.' The duty of the Jud ge (quaesitor)
was to preside and to regulate the proceedings in terms of the law
under which he acted. The duty of the Jury (who as a body were
termed consilium, while the individual members of the panel were
called iudices) was, aster hearing the pleadings and the evidence, to
pronounce upon the guilt or innocence of the accused. The praetors
were the ordinary presidents of these standing commissions, anZl

. although their number was increased from six to eight by Sulla,

criminal business increased so rapidly, that not only did the number of
quaestiones exceed the total number of praetors, but it was found neces·
sary to divide the amizo among several judges‚
and subsequently to appoint supplementary or assistant judges, who
were called iudices quaestionis. See on this whole subject Ramsay’s
Introd. to the speech pro Cluentio pp.. 30—34‚ also Rom. Ant.

p. 288 ff. On the president of the quaestio a'e sodaliciis see Intr. ἓ 32.

sl quaesitor huic edendus fuisset] ‘ if a president must have been
nominatcd by my client,’ if he had had to nominate the president of the
court before which he was to be tried, Kenn. Gr. p. 480.

known, a neighbour and sellow-tribesman.’ So Wunder, but Orelli
understands quaesitorem af ter habet.

anxiety sor the acquittal of Plancius, which he openly professes without
exciting any suspicion of partisanship‚ proves at once that there was
