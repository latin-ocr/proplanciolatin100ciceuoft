should measure his conduct, and that may sometimes require a change of
attitude. (ξ 91—§ 94.)

Lastly, Cicero gives a detailed account of his life in exile from the
time of his departure from Rome and shows what real dangers (notwith-
standing Laterensis’ assertion to the contrary) threatened him everywhere,
until Plancius befriended him at the risk of his own safety and esta-
blished thereby the strongest possible claim to his gratitude. (ξ 95-

5 ιοο.)

L. Cassius was subscriptor to Laterensis. See Intr. ἓ 7.

1. 29. ne illum quidem Iuventium tecum expostulavi] ‘I have
not called you to account about that Iuventius.' Expostulare aliquid cum
aliquo means ‘to complain about a thing to a person who has done it‚’
‘ conqueri de iniuria apud eum qui fecit ; Ruhnk. dict. ad Terent. p. 66.’
Cf. Ter. Andr. IV ῐ, 15 (630) adeamne ad eum et cum eo iniuriam

Iuventium] a member of the same gens as Laterensis, perhaps
Iuventius Thalna, who, as the first plebeian curule aedile, must pro-
bably be placed in the first year after the constitution of the curule
aedileship, that is, in Rc. 365, in the consulship of L. Genucius Aven- ’
tinensis and Q. Servilius Ahala (Liv. V11 1).

1. 32. si tibi ita respondeam, nescisse ceu] ‘ were I to answer you
to the following effect, that the public of Rome were not aware of it, and
‘that there has been no one to tell us of it, especially now that Congus
is dead, you would not, Ι imagine, be surprised, since I myself, though I
am something of an antiquary, confess that I have never heard it until

given by the celebrated orator M. Antonius in Cic. de or. 1 ξ 256:
reliqua vero etiamsi adiuvant, historiam dico et prudentiam iuris
publici et antiquitatis memoriam et exemplorum copiam, si quando opus

veterem nobilitatem Cassius praeiactaverat hunc aedilem primo ante alios

est, vulgus imperitorum iudicare paenitus de familiae clarioris nobili-
