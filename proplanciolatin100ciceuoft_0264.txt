the Greek town Hipponium, on the west coast of Bruttium, on the
shores of the bay named after it sinus Hipponiates or Vibonen-
sis, now the gulf of St Euxenia. Originally a colony of the Locri
Epizephyrii, it was destroyed by Dionysius in Β. c. 389 but restored by
the Carthaginians in B-C. 379, soon after which it fell into the hands of
the Bruttii. Upon the close of the second Punic war, the Romans
colonised it, and gave it the name of Vibo Valentia. Cicero speaks
os it (Verr. 11 5 § 40) as an illustre nobileque municipium, and Appian
B. C. 1v 3, as one of the most flourishing cities in Italy. Its position
rendered it a convenient place to touch at in passing from or to Sicily.
Thus we find Cicero in B.c. 44 proceeding a Vibone od Veliam par-
vulo navigio, and thence to Rhegium, Verr. 11 2 ἓ 99, cf. ep. ad Att.
XVI 6, 1 perveni...ad Vibonem octavo die e Pompeiano, cum unum
diem Veliae constitissem. The modern city Monte Leone occupies
the same site.

Brundisium] the modern Brindisi, a town in Calabria on the
coast os the Adriatic, colonised by the Romans in B.c. 244, was their
chief naval station in those seas on account of the excellence of its
harbour (Brundisium pulcro praecinctum praepete portu Ennius Ann.
VI 53). It was the terminus of the via Appia, and its position, as the
usual place of embarkation for Greece and the Eastern provinces,
naturally rendered it the scene of many historical incidents during the
end of the Republic and under the Empire. See Dz‘ct. Geogr. s. v. Vol. 1
p. 445. Cf. ep. ad Att. 111 4 a Vibone subito discessimus....Illo (sc.
fines lege praescriptos) cum pervenire non liceret, statim iter Brun-
disi um versus contuli ante diem rogationis, ne et Sicca, apud quem eram,
periret et quod fllelltae esse non licebat.
