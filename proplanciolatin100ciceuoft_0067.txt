that they regarded Antonius as a traitor.

5. Protest against the proposal made by Q. Fufius Calenus of
negotiations with Antonius : he should be declared a public enemy.

6. Appeal to the people: the embassy to Antonius would be in
vain : war with him is inevitable.

7. Protest in the senate against those who clamoured sor peace.

8. Protest against any half measures : the war against Antonius is

{gestant} 1εἰηῖίιιῖιη ; his partisans should be required to submit before the

9. Special honours ought to be paid to the memory of the illustri-
ous jurist, Servius Sulpicius, who had died on the embassy to Antonius.

10. Panegyric on M. Brutus and recommendation that he should

’ Besides these speeches we have fragments of about 20
more, by far the most important of which are those of the
two Cornelianae, of the oratio in toga candzkla, and of the
speech pro M. Aemilio Scauro ,· and we know of 33 others
having been delivered by Cicero.
