bellum, nisi ridiculum παρὰ προσδοκίαν, nisi εείενα...ἔντεχνα et arguta

apparebunt, ut sacramento contendas mea non esse.

1. 4. solvit legem] ⁴ voted for the law. Cf. or. de prov. cons. ς 36
qui ulteriorem (Galliam decernit), simul ostendit eam se sciscere legem,
quam esse legem neget, according to the reading of Orelli. Wunder
quotes Festus under N iqui sczvit: nam sciscito significat sententiam
dzczto ac suffragium serto; unde scita plebis.

1. 5. consul] C. Julius Caesar ln B. C. 69. His law (lex Iulia de
publi'canzs) enacted, that a third of the amount of their contract should
be remitted to the publicani. Suet. Iul. Caes. c. 20 publicanos remis-
sionem petentes tertia mercedum parte relevavit; ac ne in locatione
novorum vectigalium immoderatius licerentur propalam monuit ; Dio
Cass. XXXVII! 7 τοὺς δ’ ἱππέας ὁ Καῖσαρ ἀνηρτήσατο τὸ τριτημόριόν
σφισι τῶν τελῶν οἳ ἐμεμίσθωτο ἀφείςε cf. ep. ad Att. 11²16‚ 2. ‘The
‘ publicani’ had either bid too large a sum at first or had suffered through
the devastation caused by Mithridates.’ This law secured to Caesar
the goodwill of the equites. ‘ Paulo supra locutus sum nihil obtineri
potuisse per C. Caesarem, cum publicanis apud senatum patrocinaretur,
contradicente scilicet M. Catone. Verum postea consul idem C. Caesar
legem tulit ad publicanorum commoda pertinentem, cui favore promp-
tissimo Cn. Plancii pater sine dubio adstitit, quoniam res utilitatis
suae agebatur. Hoc ergo quidquid esset reprehensionis removetur in
ipsum Caesarem legis auctorem nuper latae? SCHOL. AMBR.

1 8. utrum id sortis esse vis cen] ‘do you say this is owing to
chance, or to the proposer of the law?’ The order m which each of the
tribes had to vote was determined by lot or by the decision of the pre-
siding magistrate, who acted as polling- c,-lerk in the present case is qui
legem ferebat, viz. Caesar. The tribe which was called upon to vote
first was st yled t7 ibus pri'nczpzum or mbas praerogativa, and the tribes
which followed inre vocatae. See Ramsay Rom. ant. p. 12 5, and cf.
Liv. xxiv 7, 12, xxvii 6, 3.

1. 9. si sortis] sc. esse vis3 Kenn. Gr. p. 413.

1. 10. splendor etiam Plancfi] ‘it is even a high distinction to
Plancius...the defendant.' hunc] sc. patrem Plancii. Cobet, sol-
lowed by Kbpke and Hirschfelder, reads tunc.

ἐξ 36—56. Second Part of ‘ohe speech

Cicero proceeds to slzow the weakness of tlze prosecutor’s arguments on
tlte employment of bribery and corruption by Plancius. Laterensis professed
to prosecute Plancius under tlze Iex Licinia de sodaliciis, but lze clzarged
