Caesar, when having organised a conspiracy against the government,
he was assassinated in his own hall, while exclaiming ‘ecquando‚ pro-
pinqui amicique, similem mei civem habebit res publica ,θ’ He was the
author of many laws (leges Liviae) the whole of which were summarily
annulled immediately after his death, on the plea that they had been
passed informally (uno versiculo senatus puncto temporis sublatae sunt de

a double sense, according to the tone in which they are uttered ‘how
do you do?' and ‘what are you about?' Drusus used them in the
former sense, Granius in the latter, meaning that he was doing mischief.
