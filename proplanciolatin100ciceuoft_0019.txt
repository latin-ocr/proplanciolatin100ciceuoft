After this oration Cicero at the request of Cn. Pompeius de-
fended L. Cornelius Balbus, a native of Gades, on a charge
of exercising the Roman franchise illegally.

§ 3. The year 55 B.C. (=699 A. U. c.) opened with great
disturbance. The electioris still continued to be interrupted‚
so that it became necessary to appoint an Interrex, and it was
only at the conclusion of the first quarter that Cn. Pompeius
Magnus and M. Licinius Crassus, consuls each for the
second time, were able to enter upon the duties of their office.
While the tribune of the plebs Gaius Trebonius proposed his
bill to the popular assembly (lex T rebonia) that the consular

which Piso addressed to the senate in answer to the charges
Cicero had made against him. Crassus carried his lex de so-

elections of the next year. An election of aediles for the year
Β. C. 54, which should have taken place under his presidency,
