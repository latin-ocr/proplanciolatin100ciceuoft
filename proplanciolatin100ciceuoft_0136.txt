1. 27. alteros] sc. the people of Tusculum.

1. 28. nam malevolos non esse certo seio] ‘for Ι am sully per-
suaded, have sure knowledge, that they are not ill-natured.’ On the
difference between certe scio (which is found in some Mss here) and certo
scio see Mr Reid’s note on the Cat. mai. ἓ 2 l. 18. On the allusion con·
tained in malevolos see note of the Scholia Bobiensia quoted above.
The same scholiast suggests that Cicero is here speaking ironically:
‘Hoc dicitur ab eo ἐν ἠθει; quippe curn diversum intellegi velit, simulat
contra Tusculanos verecundiam malevolentiae negatione.

1. 31. de fratre meo] Q. Tullius Cicero, brother of the orator,
was born B-C. 102. He accompanied his elder brother to Athens
13.c. 79 (de fin. V 1), where he studied rhetoric with him. In 65 he
was plebeian aedile, and in 63, the year of his brother's consulship,
he was designated as praetor for the following year. From B.c. 61 to
B. C. 59 he was propraetor of Asia (or. p. Flacco ἓ 33 §49 ξ 52). On his
return to Rome in Β. C. 58, he exerted himself strenuously to procure the
recall of his brother from exile (or. p. Sest. ἓ 76, ep. ad Att. IV 3 ἓ 2).
In B.C. 57 he was made legatus to Pompeius, when the latter had potestas
rei frumentariae toto orbe terrarum committed to his charge z in B.C. 55
he accompanied Caesar on his expedition to Britain as his legatus, and
became distinguished for his services in Gaul. Later, in Β. C. 51, he was
his brother’s legate in Cilicia. In the civil war between Caesar and
Pompeius he joined the latter (ep. ad Att. IX 1, 6), but after the battle
of Pharsalia (B.C. 48) he quarrelled with his brother and made his peace
with Caesar. In B.C. 43 he fell a victim to the proscription of the
triumvirs. Quintus was married to Atticus’ sister Pomponia, but their
union was an unhappy one (ep. ad Att. V 1 &c.).

1. 32. agri—montesque] A similar hyperbolical personification
occurs below ἓ 22, cp. or. p. Mil. ἓ 20, or. p. Rabir. ξ 8 cum ad eius
