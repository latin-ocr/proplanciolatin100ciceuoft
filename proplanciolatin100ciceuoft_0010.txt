The present commentary will be found exhaustive, as
I have taken account of every word and phrase in the
speech likely to create difficulty and left none unexplained3
and, though perhaps to critics some of my notes may appear
unnecessarily ample or too elementary, teachers will not
think them so who know how much assistance students
require, especially when they have not the opportunity of
consulting good books of reference or the inclination to
appeal to original authorities. My guides throughout have
been the editions of Wunder and of Kopke: the former,
produced at the expense of seven years' labour, is especially
valuable for illustrationâ€š and I acknowledge once for all
my great obligations to it: the Introduction is mainly taken
from the latter. Frequent references have been made to
the best Grammars in use 3 for experience has taught me
that this is the surest means of fixing the important prin-
ciples of syntax in the mind. The principal variations of
reading have been given in an Appendix on the text,
and full Indexes haye been added (1) of proper names
and (2) of all the words and phrases which have been
commented on in the notes. The Chronological Table
of the principal events in the life of Cicero with especial
indications of names mentioned in this speech, and a list
of his other extant speeches, will be found useful to-
students preparing for an examination.

In short, I have spared no pains to make the edition as
complete and trustworthy as a book should be which appears
under the auspices of a great University.
