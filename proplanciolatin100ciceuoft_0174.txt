106 PRO CN. PLANCIO [XVI §38—

1. 8. Lemonia tribus] This was one of the original sixteen country
tribes ε the Oufentina was enrolled in B.c. 518 (=A.U.C. 436) Liv. IX 20,
6. Festus p. 194 Ousentinae tribus initio causa suit nomen fluminis
Oufens, quod est in agro Privernate mare intra et T aracinam.
The Clustumina was one of the old 21 tribes dating according to
Livy XLII 34 from 494 B.C. The territory attached to it was roun'd
the old Sabine town Crustumerium, also called Crustumeria and
more rarely Crustumium, which was conquered by Rome finally in
B.C. 499, Liv. 11 19, Reid or. p. Balb. ξ 57.

nam Maeciam] ‘ for, as for the tribus Maecia, you named it not to
judge him but to be challenged by him.' On this use of nam elliptic see
note on ξ 21 1. 13, ἓ 70 1. 3. The Maecia would, he knew, be rejected
by Plancius for some reason or other, perhaps because Laterensis him-

self belonged to it, and consequently must have had such influence in ,

it, that it seemed to Plancius the most likely one to be p'rejudiced of
the four tribes named by his accuser. It was in Latium in the neigh-
bourhood of Lanuvium, and so called from the castrum Maecium,
founded in B.C. 332 (=A.U.C. 422)‚under the consuls A. Cornelius Cossus
Arvina and Cn. Domitius Calvinus, by the censors Q. Publilius Philo
and Sp. Postumius (Liv. V111 17, 11).

g 39, 1. 11. 11011 ad sententiam legis cen] ‘not according to the
intention of the law (i. e. the opinion expressed by the senate when they
made the Sctum previous to the enactment of the law, rationem quam in.
decernendo secuti sumus) but according to some definite expectations
of his own.’ The law meant that the tribes suspected of being bribed
should be named (edi); Laterensis by not naming them freed them from
such suspicion: he hoped that the other tribes which he proposed
would condemn Plancius. Intr. ξ 28. For the meaning of ad (=Gr.
κατὰ) cf. de fin. Ι 9, 30 quid aut ad naturam aut contra sit, where
Madvig observes that esse ad rem is an unusual expression, while such
phrases as fieri ad voluntatem (Cic. de off. 1 ξ 91. 26), or sapiens ad
aliquam normam (de amicit. ἓ 18), are common.

1. 12. de civitate]=ex omni populo, ‘out of all the tribes,⁷
§40 l. 17, Intr. §gn

1. 13. magnas necessitudines] ‘intimate relations,’ or. p. Sest.
ξ 39 M. Crassus, quocum milzz’ omnes erant amicitiae necessitu-
dines, or. pro Ligar.§ 21 haec novi ego propter omnes necessitudines
quae milzz· sunt cum L. Tuberone, or. p. Quinct.§ 48 is quicum tibi

affinitas, societas, omnes denique causae et necessitudines intercede-
bant.

oum ille 11011 ediderlt] ‘inasmueh as he did not name,' ‘by not

naming,’ ἓ 29 l. 19 n, ξ 42 l. 12, Roby Gr. ΙΙ. 17129, Madv. Gr. 5 358
abs. 2. The subjunctive is used although cum precedes (see n. on ἕ 29
l. 19) because it is dependent on and assimilated to iudicarit.

1. 14. officiis ab hoc observatas] ‘that they have received atten-
tion from my client in the way of dutiful services? ἕ 45 1. 9 ne ob·
