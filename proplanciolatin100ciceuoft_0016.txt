reproaches that he had not opposed force to force, even though
it should have cost him his life, and deplored the fatal step he
took in leaving Rome before he was directly impeached. His
letter addressed to Atticus (111 19) on the 16th of September
is a living testimony of the impatience and deep despondency
which had laid hold on him. When his enemy Piso entered
on his province of Macedonia, Thessalonica was no longer a

published a bill (rogatio) for his recalll4, which was supported by
the consul elect P. Cornelius Lentulus Spinther, but opposed by
the consuls Piso and Gabinius and by the tribune Ligus. On
the first of January in B. C. 57 Lentulus now consul proposed
Cicero's restoration3 a great fight ensued in the forum, in
which the tribune P. Sestius nearly lost his life, and was
obliged to collect a force for his defence. Milo attempted to
bring Clodius to trial on the charge of riot (de vi), but in vain.
The senate passed a resolution of thanks to Cn. Plancius for

the protection of governors of provinces, and to summon the
