by caprice than guided by sober judgment in voting‚ especially sor one
of the minor and comparatively unimportant state offices‚ and therefore

as decisive and acquiesced in and not reversed 3 nor must the result be
visited on the successful candidate (§§ 6—11).

§⁵‚ 1. 29. in causa facili] ‘notwithstanding its being a simple
and straightforward case,' see n. on de off. 11 ξ 4 1. 17.

1. 30. lubrica] in opp. to explicatus: the latter is ‘disentangled,
plain and clear‚’ the former ‘uneven‚ and a cause 'of going wrong and
stumbling.’ Cf. locus lubricus de off. Ι ξ 65. ‘Significat Cicero Plan·

1. 32. tamen id ipsum ceu] ‘yet even that would be an irksome‚
unpleasant, task in the case of such familiarity and friendship as exists

1. 33. vetus est enim] The particles enim, autem, {eitun which
usually occupy the second place in the clause, after est sunt are usually
placed third—(a) when, as here, the predicate stands first with est as
necesse est enim Tusc. 1 59, moriendum est enim ib.—(b) when the
subject stands first and the predicate follows, expressed by a relative
clause as de nat. deor. 11 ἓ 133 ratio est enim, quae praestet omnibus,
de fin. 1 §43 sapientia est enim una, quae eet.—-(c) where the sentence
begins with non (neque) est (sunt), whether the subject or predicate
stands first, as Tusc. 1 ἓ 46 neque est enim ullus sensus in corpore—
(d) where either the demonstrative pronouns hic, haec, hoc, is, ea, id or
the interrogatives quis, quae, quid, or the negatives nullus, nemo, nilzil,

Madv. de fin. 1 §43. Some critics think that this position of the par-
ticles makes est etc. more emphatic: others on the contrary that they
are to be regarded as enclitics, and that stress is to be laid on the
word which immediately precedes them.

vetus lex iustae veraeque amicitiae] ‘long-established law of per-
fect and pure friendship.’ On the meaning of iustus see my n. on de
off. 111 ξ 108 1. 7, and for verus cf. de am. ἓ 22. For the sentiment cf.
