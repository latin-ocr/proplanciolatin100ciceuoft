reckoned. As sodalicius is an adjectiveffl, the full title is
collegia sodalicia, as it appears in inscriptions and in the

κ Digests132. They were really a revival os the sodalitates in
‘ ¹ another form. In 5ο far as they were associations of members

of tribes for the pursuit of a definite object, they were collegia.
But as they resembled the original sodali‘tates ln the support

¹ which their members afforded to each other in the courts of

justice, in popular assemblies and at elections, these collegia
were sodalicia. Thus they were political clubs within the trisbu ,
founded often by the candidates themselves, as by Ρ. Clodius
in B. C. 58. Their principal‚ if not their only, aim was to or·
ganise and retain in their own hands a system of bribery¹33, so
as, if possible, to divert any charge of ambitus from the candi—
dates to themselves, trusting to their numbers to afford them

K security. So the old evil reappeared in a new form. Hence
such a collegium is called134 a consensio qnae magis honeste
Ἰῖ quam vere sodalitas nominatur, because it is not really a

sodalitas in the primary sense of the word. But since each
member of a collegium sodalicium may be also spoken of as a
sodalis, we find Cicero in ξ 46 saying cupidos et gratiosos—tu

ἓν si sod a l is vocas, officiosam amicitiam nomine inquinas cri-

mznoso.

d'accusation of Gnaeus Plancius, was for the organisation of
clubs in order to exercise undue influence over the elections135.
But Laterensis, in order to gain his cause, must prove, which he
failed to do, these facts z—Plancium decuriasse, conscripsisse,
sequestrem fuisse, pronunciasse, divisisse, that he had planned
a decuriatio tribulium and a discriptio populi.
