that you have fastened on the man who did not entreat you to sorbear
prosecution. Laterensis says tlmt Plancius bribed the Voltinia tribus
and that lte lias witnesses to the fact out eff tlzat tribus, more in number
than lze lzad votes in that tribus. Cicero answers ‘ lfthe tribe was bribed,
he must be either producing· some men as witnesses, who did not vote sor
lzim because tlzey were bribed (by somebody else), or llzat lle did not get
even tlzeir votes for nothing; i. e. if tlzey were not bribed by another, they
must have been bribed by himself: for tlze tribe was bribed. As to tlze
sum of money which was found in tlte Circus Flaminius, and was sus· r
pected to liave been intended for tlte bribed voters, since no claimant came
forwardfor it, zf you thought Plancius had auytking to do witlz it, you
miglct lzave prosecuted tlte suspected party, and so, if you had succeeded
in condemning him, obtained presumptive proof of tlte complicity of
Plancius.

by the following arguments? ‘ Can you doubt,’ says Laterensis, ‘that

a coalition was entered into between Plancius and Plotius, when they
carried the majority of the tribes?'

To this question Cicero replies ‘Could they possibly have been
