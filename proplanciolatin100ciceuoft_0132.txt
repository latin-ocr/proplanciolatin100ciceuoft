1. 30 si quando, ut nt‚1actor cet] ‘,whenever as often happenS,
I am jostled in a c1owd; I don’t find fault with the person who is at
the top of the Sacra via, while I am being pushed along near the
F ab1an arch, but with the man who actually runs up against me and
pushes me.' Mr Nichols (Roman Forum p. 126) says ‘The Sacred
way, at the point where it entered the Forum, after passing the Regia,
was spanned by the Fornix Fabius, one of, the earliest of a class of
monuments which were afterwards so numerous at Rome and in im·
periai times were multiplied to satiety. This commemorative arch was
erected by Q. Fabius Maximus Allobrogicus, consul 13.C. 121,
by means of the plunder gained in his campaign against the Allobroges
and Arverni, tribes of Gaul.... Cicero reports a saying of Crassus
about Memmius, that he thought himself so great a man, that he could
not come down into the Forum without stooping his head at the Arch
of Fabius (de orat. 11 §267‚ where it is called fornix Fabii). Cp.
Pseudo-Ascon. ad Cic. Verr. Ι 7 ξ 18, where it appears as fornix
Fabianus. ‘ The narrow part of the Sacred way between the Arch of
Fabius and the top of the slope would naturally become crowded when
a number of people were either entering or leaving the open space of
the F orum.' BURN Rome andvtlze Campagna, p. 78.
