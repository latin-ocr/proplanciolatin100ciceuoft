Catoni, homini rgrnolo et novo, quo omnes quasi exemplari ad indus-
triam virtutemque ducimur, cerle licuit Tusculi se z'n otio delectare
salubri et propinquo loco). He passed the earlier years of his life in
parsimonia atque z'n duritia atque industria, agro colendo, saxis Sabi-
nis silicibus repastinandis atque conserendis (Fest. p. 281). He entered
the army as a common (ordinarius) soldier about the time of the battle
of lake Trasimenus, but subsequently served as military tribune under
Marcellus in Sicily, under Fabius at the capture of Tarentum 13.C. 209
(de sen. ἓ 10), and under C. Claudius Nero at the battle of the Metau-
rus. In B.C. 204, at the age of thirty, he began his political career
with the quaestorship, and served under Scipio Africanus in Sicily and
Africa, but their habits and views of lise differed so much that he was

Α allowed to return to Rome. In B.C. 199 Cato was plebeian aedile, in

Β. C. 198 he was chosen praetor and obtained the province of Sardinia,
which he ruled with the strictest economy and justice. In Β. c. 195 he
was elected consul with L. Valerius Flaccus, being the first novus homo
elected since C. Flaminius the consul of B.C. 217 carried on a success—
ful war in his province Hispania citerior and triumpbed on his return.
When the war against Antiochus broke out he served on the staff of the
consul M’. Acilius Glabrio as legatus consularis (Liv. XXXVI 17, 1) or,
according to Cic. de sen. ἓ 10, as tribunus militum, and the decisive
victory of the battle of Thermopylae, by which Antiochus was driven
out of Greece, was mainly owing to him. From this time his military
career ended ; and sor the next forty years he was the leading figure on
the stage of Roman politics, distinguishing himself by his vehement
opposition to the Roman nobles, especially the Scipios. In B.C. 184 he
was censor with his old friend Flaccus, but all his struggles against the
degeneracy and luxury of the times during his tenure of this office
proved unavailing. His life-long prejudice against Carthage is well
known, and how he always ended his speech, whatever was the subject,
with ‘ceterum censeo delendam esse Carthagc'nem.' He died B.C. 149
before the conclusion of the war. Cato enriched the Latin language
with several literary works. His de re rustica is a miscellany of maxims
relating to domestic and rural economy: his ἀποφθέγματα (Cic. de off.
1§ 104, de orat. 115 271) is a collection of witty sayings from Greek
and Roman sources. We have also fragments of some of his speeches, .
the titles of ninety of which are still known. His greatest work, how-
ever, was the Origines, the first historical work in Latin, many frag-
ments of which are extant (ἕ 661. 16). His antipathy to the Greeks
and their literature showed itself in various acts, as when he urged the
removal of the famous embassy from Athens in B-C. 153. There is a
splendid and celebrated portrait of him in Livy XXXIX 40. His bio-
graphers are Cornelius Nepos, Plutarch and Aurelius Victor. Some

{laets also relating to him are found in Cicero's Brutus and the treatise
e senectute.
