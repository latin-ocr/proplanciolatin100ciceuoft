the coitio between C. Antonius Hybrida, son of the orator, and
Catiline‚ and by Cicero himself in this speech ⁸3 where we are led
to conclude that before the first interrupted election Plotius and
Plancius had promised the second votes of the tribes on whom
they could rely to Pedius and Laterensis respectively‚ but that
previously to the second election—ne in angustum venirent—
they had promised each other the votes which they had respec-
tively at their disposal. Cicero further refers to a coitio inhis
speech on behalf of Milo&4 where it is stated that Clodius was
successful in bringing about a coalition between Milo's rivals
in order to exclude him from the consulate (deicere honore).

ξ 13. Coitio was not subject to any penal laws, so long as it
was not employed for purposes dangerous to social order.
Such a coitio was that between the Triumviri at Luca in B.C.
55 to prevent Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus from being a can-
didate for the consulship because he had threatened that he
would, if elected, carry into execution the measures he had pro-
posed in his praetorship85. In the same way C. Memmius
and Cn. Domitius Calvinus in B.C. 54-—when the former was
supported by Caesar, the latter by L. Domitius Ahenobarbus
and Appius Claudius Pulcher, the consuls of the current year—
caballed to exclude Scaurus Pompey's candidateffi. So also
Lucceius and Balbus caballed to exclude Caesar. Another rea-
son why coitiones were not subject to any legal enactment was
