that= I am presumptuous because &c.' Kenn. Gr. ξ 218, p. 47 3.

1. 24. de aliquo non impetravit] ‘was not successful in his suit
for some one.' The person meant is T. Ampius Balbus, tribune of
the plebs 13.C. 63, the year of Cicero's consulship, who proposed that
Pompeius (vir amplissimus cett), then absent srom Rome, should on
account of his Asiatic victories be allowed to wear a crown of bay-
leaves and all the insignia of a triumph at the Circensian games, and
also a crown of hay-leaves and the praetexta at the scenic gamcs, Vell.
Patere. 11 40: ut is (Pompeius) ludis Circensibus corona laurea et omni
cultu triumphantium uteretur, scaenicis autem praetexta coronaque laurea.
Pompeius showed his gratitude to him by supporting him in his candi·
dature for the aedsseship, in whicH, however, he was then unsuccessful,
though he obtained the praetorship in B. C. 58. In the civil war B.C. 49
he showed himself so strong a partisan of the Pompeian party, that his
enemies called him tuba belli civilis. He was banished by Caesar, but
afterwards obtained his pardon through the intercession of Cicero, who
wrote him a letter on the occasion ep. ad fam. VI 12. W. Ramsay,

‘Sagacissime animadvertit, quid a parte diversa posset opponi:
non mirum, si (non) nihil pro Plancio Tullius valuisse videatur, cum
pro alio sibi coniunctissimo candidato vir potentissimus nihil promo-
verit, cum illi designando studeret. SIgnificare autem candidatum
videtur T. Ampium, suffragatorem vero Cn. Pompeium: de quibus
tam se quam Pompeio sic vult accipi Tullius suspicionem, ut ipse qui-
dem pro Plancio valuerit miserabiliter et demisse petend03 Pompeius
non item pro Tito Ampio, utique pro sublimitate nominis et potentiae
superbius hoc sibi aput populum vindicans.’ SCHOL. AMBR-

1. 27. rogatio ipsa semper est, gratiosissima cea] ‘the act of
soliciting a vote in itself (independently of who the canvasser may be) is
always most efficacious, appeals most to the feelings, when it is most
based upon the claims of friendship; for I did not solicit in such a
manner as made it appear that I was canvassing for him, merely be-
cause he was a persona] friend or a neighbour or because I had always
been on the most intimate terms with his father, but as for one who
· might be said to be the saviour of my life. It was no influence of mine,
‘but the motive of my request that won the hearts of men. Not a man
'was glad at my restoration from exile, not a man was grieved at the
>wrongsI endurcd, who has not felt gratitude for the pity Plancius had
‘on me.

connexion.' This is the genitive of possession or relation, N agelsb. lat.
