1. 14. grave] sc. iudicibus, ‘a serious matter sor the court to
pronounce, He (Plancius) is more deserving than the other (Laterensis). '
‘How then is it more equitable that he should be elected rather than
the otherP' In this way, I take it: for here lies the point, this 15 enough
for the judge, ‘he was elected.’ ‘Why your client rather than myselst'

1. 17. quod 1111111 gravissimum esset—non recte] gravissimum erat
Ciceroni, si dicebat non recte Plancium Laterensi esse praepositum, ex
quo consequi videbatur, ut Plancium largitione populum corrupisse con·

Plancii perdere existumari, cum populus, id quod supra docuit, sine iu-
dicio magistratus creare soleat, ideoque ex eo, quod quis non recte sit
sactus, minume sequatur, ut largitione corrupisse populum censendus sit,
cumque populi factum licet non probandum tamen serendum sit. W.

personal merits I can justify the people’ 5 choice of Plancius and
prove that he did not employ unworthy expedients to carry 1115 616611011,
but availed himself of the ordinary avenues to office which are open to
the son of a Roman knight. The other candidates Plotius and Pedius
were also sons of Roman knights. Why be angry with Plancius rather
than with the one who was immediately above you in the poll (§§ 1 7,18)?
Your high rank was no doubt' m your favour, and you think it ought to
have secured your election: no doubt there are many who prize high
rank, but it is no fault of ours if there are many more who do not.
