APPENDIX ΟΝ ΤΗΕ ΤΕΧΤ

A. General Remarks

The text of this edition of the Planciana is founded mainly upon
that of Kayser as given in Vol. V of the excellent edition of Cicero's
works (edited by Baiter and Kayser and published by B. G.
Tauclinitz, Leipzig, 1862). There is not much difference between the
text of their edition and that of Baiter in Orelli's Cicero ed. 2, Zurieh
1856: in matters however of orthography it is generally considered
superior. Kayser’s text is based upon two principal MSSz one (¹1¹)
from the monastery of Tegerns ee in Bavaria‚ now in the library of
Munich (cod. Lat. 18787) first collated for Garatoni. It was lost sight
of for half a century, but luckily fell into the hands of Baiterl, who
bought it from a bookseller in Paris, whither it is said to have been
taken from Hungary. It is probably not earlier than the 11th century.
The second (Ε) was formerly at Erfurt, and is now at Berlin, Both
are derived apparently from one and the same original, which was cor-
rupt and interpolated. Thus in ch. x ἓ 26 Ε alone preserves the true
reading civili ferra, all the other MSS have civili errore, and in ch.
XXXIV ἓ 83 all MSS present the faulty reading ex illo ambitu traxisse,
sor exsilio ambitum sanxisse.

There are twenty-four MSS besides 'these which have been accurately,
and nine which have been inaccurately collated3 of the former Laurenti-
anus tertius (Le), the third of those of the Medici Library at Florence, is
Et‘fissss'ffidmbayniviindekssffigeaffgeffstta ²3225353313⁰{{?2t2?ht231?t33y
and they are all incomparably inferior to ¹1· and ΞΕ. Wunder points out
that there are only two passages in the whole speech, in which any one
of them gives the right reading where ¹1· and ’.Β have a corrupt one, viz.
,ξ 47 where the latter have nam for iam, and ἓ 95, in quo sor quod.

The most ancient Commentary on the Text is contained in a folio
now in the Ambrosian Library at Milan, to which it was brought
from the famous monastery of St Columba at Bobio about the be-
ginning of the 7th century. It is a codex rescriptas or palimpsest (the
superinduced MS containing a Latin translation of a portion os the Acts
