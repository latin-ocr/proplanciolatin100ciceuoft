⁷ panies; thus we read of collegia opificum123 at Rome, and in
the provinces there were collegia naviculariorum, or ‘companies
of ship and boat owners.' Others were of a religious character, as
>the collegia pontificum, augurum, epulonum, fi‘atrum arvaliumj
others were bodies concerned in administration as praetorum,

²22 ‘Wunder (Prolegomena p.
LKXIV) supposes that certain men
named sodales, who were bribed
by a candidate, compelled or
'brought together (cogebant) the
multitude to vote for the briber;
and that to each sodalis a candi-
date assigned a certain part of a
tribe sor him to look after, and
that it was the business of these
supposed sodales to procure votes
for the candidates in whatever
way they could. But this is a
new meaning of the word sodales,
whereas the law would take the

, word in the usual, old-established

acceptation; and, if it did not,

’ it would be necessary for the law

γ to give a new meaning to the
term and to detine it ; and how,
we inay ask, could those election
agents appointed by the several
candidates form a sodalicium, when
the only connexion between them
was the fact of their working for
their employer, and sodalicium was
a term already used sor clubs and
associations which were common
in Rome? Nor could the voting
be managed in such a way as
Wunder supposes, for men could

not be driven to the poll by force
(vi), and even if what we call un-
due influence and intimidation
were used, the voter had the ballot
to protect him, and the ballot was
effectual (or. p. Plane. ἕ [6).’

the lex Licinia that it was specially ξ
directed against a particular mode ἕ
of canvassing‚ which consisted in ,
employing agents (sodales) to mark ζ
out the members of the several ἱ

tribes into smaller portions, and

to secure more effectually the votes ι

by this division of labour. This
distribution of the tribes was called
decuriatio (or. p. Plane. ἓ 4 5).

(Plin. N. H. 34, 1 ξι), lignarii,
fictores, ferrarii, aurifices, fullones,
pistores, tibicines et fidicines Roma-

sunt. (The strike of the tibicines
recorded in Livy lx 30 reads like
an account of a modern trades-
union). Cf. Hor. Sat. 1. 2.
