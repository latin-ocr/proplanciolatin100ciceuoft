‘witty,' as in de or. 11 ἓ 227 faceta aulem et urbana innumerabilia
vel ex una contione meministis, ἓ 236. That Cic. in his speeches was

. convinced of the rhetorical effect of wit is plain from several passages,

his speeches as well as in ordinary conversation. His bon-mols were
circulated freely. Caesar included some of them in his collection of

not: for Cic. complains (ad Fam. VII 32 quoted below l. 3) that many
sayings were fathered on him, which he was not responsible for. C.
Trebonius made a similar collection (e . ad farn. XV ἓ 2); 2150 Cicero's
freedman Tiro, if the *three books ascribed to him are genuine. Macro-
bius doubts their genuineness (Saturn. 11 ι ἓ 12), and so does Quintilian
who (Inst. VI 3, 5) at the same time regrets their publication, as in-
jurious to the orator’s reputation. Some of his jokes were very frigid
(insalibus aliquando finfflklus, Quintil. XII 10§ 12), and as Laterensis
left none of Cicero's failings unnoticed, he upbraided him with his
passion sor humorous sayings (ἓ 85) in his speech against Plancius;

and if the wit, which he deprived Cic. of the opportunity of indulging,
was not to be of a higher order than such specimens we have of his,

as the pun on Verres’ name (or. in Verr.1 ἓ 121, IV ἓ 95), it was
as well that the opportunity was lost. The whole of this passage from
ego quia to conferuntur is bracketed as spurious by Kopke aster Koe-
nighoff, Criticon et Exegetieon pars 111 Trier 1861 p. 14.

Ρ. 15, 1. 2. scitum] scitus is equivalent to our English word
‘knowing,' in the sense of ‘clever‚’ ‘smart.’ See Ramsay's note on
