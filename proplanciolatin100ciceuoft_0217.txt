1. 23. negociatoribus—mercatortbusq sc. visus eram. The two
classes are distinguished, Verr. 11 2 ξ 188 mercator an negociator an
arator. The former were the Roman money-lenders‚ bankers and
merchants on a large scale, who bought up corn on speculation; the
latter traders who went about with their goods and trafficked with the
natives‚ Long Verr. 11 2 6 ἓ 16, Ramsay [ι’. Α. p. 431.

mancipibus] the publicani who farmed the decumae. According to
Pseudo-Ascon. in Cic. Div. in Q. C. ἓ 33 they were publicanorum
principes: according to Paul. Diae. ex Festo p. 151 ed. Miiller man·

1. 28. cum casu diebus iis—forte venissem] ‘on coming to
Puteoli, for the purpose of continuin my Journey by land, which, as
chance would have it, Ι did just at tie height of the season.’ Cicero
landed at Puteoli in order to proceed thence by land to Rome
(itineris faciendi causa) as in the well-known instance of St Paul (Act.
Apost. XXVHI 13), and it so happened that his visit was just at the
time when Puteoli was full of fashionable visitors. He seems to lay
stress on the fact of his visit being accidentally at such a time, lest it
should be supposed that he courted an ovation. Puteoli (hod.
Pozzuoli) was a famous seaport-town of Campania on the east side of
the sinus Balanus. It was founded by'the Greeks of Cumae B.C. 521
under the name of Dicaearchia‚ and the name was changed to Puteoli
because of its many ‘wells’ (putei) in the second Punic War, when it
was fortified by the Romans. A colony was established there in Β. c.
194, and, being the first really good port on the south of Rome, it
became one of the most considerable emporiums of foreign trade in
Italy (Strabo, XVII p. 793), and also, like Baiae and its neighbourhood,
a favourite resort of the Roman nobility. Cicero himself had a villa
between it and the lake Avernus, which he called his Academia, other-
wise Puteolanum. The modern town retains many remains of its
former grandeur, the most famous of which are the temple of Serapis,
,and the piles or piers of its ancient mole. Festus [Paul. Diae. p. 122
MfflL] says of it : Minorem Delum Puteolos csse dixerunt, quod Delos
aliquando maximum emporium suerit totius orbis terrarum .· cui suc·
