136 PRO CN. PLANCIO [XXIV g 58

because ofhis noble birth. Cic. replies that the road to state· -ffces is open
to all alike, irrespectiveljt of their origin, and preference is given to
personal merit only; hzgh birth has this only advantage that the suc-
cesssul candidate who has it is less exposed to envy. (ἓ 58—§ 60) He
asks whether Planctus has performed (2) any remarkable mi'lztary ser-
vices, (3) whether he is conspicuous as a speaker or lawyer, that he should
have been prcfer7 ed to Late7ensi.s To which Cic. replies that Planczus
has seen a certain amount of service zn the ar my, but that he neither has
nor pretends to have any special skill as an orator, any more than he pro
J‘esses to be learned in the law. Such accomplishments indeed are not
underrated zn a candidate as accessori,es but as qualificationsfhr a state-
office they are not to be compared with vi7 tue and integrity of character.

(ξ 61—§ 62. ) (4) Cassius had extolled the services of Late7 ensis abroad,
in reply to which Cic. in stances his own example to show how zndfflr ent

people at Rome are to what goes on in the p7 ovznces T he lesson taught
him by the rebuff his own vanity once received was an zmpo7 tant one,
vi.‚z that, if a man wishes to obeam one of the higher magissstraczes he
must rely upon something else than provincial reputation, he must be ”
constantly before the public at home, and study to make as many friends
as possible, as did Plancius and others who like him have haa’ to make
their own way. Laterensis should have taken the trouble to do the same,
and the task would have been all t-he easier for hi‚m because he had the
prestige of hi <rh social rank to suppo7t and advance 'his claims. (ἓ 68-

Cicero contradicts the assertion of Cassius, that he was not more
indebted to Plancius than to other patriots‚ and that he made too much
of his services to him, when he supported him in his candidature for the
aedileship. He professes his readiness to serve any and every one of those
who had promoted his restoration from exile, whenever their exigencies
should require it. But that profession does not interfere with his obliga-
tion to serve Plancius, to whom he is indebted for preservation from the
many enemies who sought to prevent his recall, or, if not, to procure his
death, and whose threats were not, as Cassius and Laterensis gave out,
imaginary but real. Cassius spoke of two great men, as he called them,
whose services to the state did not save them from conviction, · and he
blames Czcero’s entreaties on behalf of Plancius who had not the same

personal merit as Opimius and Calidius and ought not to be saved by
Cicero'.sprayers (ἓ 6¹7—§ ¹71.)

ΙΙ. Ci’cero s reply to Laterensis himself, who had ungraciously
imputed to him falsehooa' and charged him with jeigning to be
under an obligation to Plancius for services which he never really ren-
dered, in order to suit the occasion. He says there were abundant reasons
why he should exert himself in Plancins' defence, and that Laterensis
himself} who took such a warm interest in Cicero’s affairs, gave him
permission to use all his exerticns sor Plancius‘ election, because of the
great g7atztude he felt to Plancius jor his kindness to C zce7o T he speeclc
