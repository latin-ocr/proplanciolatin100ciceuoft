INTROD UCTION

ancient institutions at Rome. It was customary for members
of such brotherhoods not to sue one another at law, but rather
to contribute to each other's defence ; it was held mean and
dishonourable not to share in expenses for their mutual sup-
port11⁸z even sons had a claim on their father's sodales1¹⁹ for
protection, and sometimes outsiders incurred the obligation of
a whole sodalitas by their support of a single sodalis120. Thus it
was but natural that candidates for state offices should be upheld
by members of their own sodalitas, who did not scruple to use
any means, lawful or unlawful, of furthering and carrying
their political ends. It is easy to see how under the guidance
of factious men these brotherhoods might be used‘for the pur-
poses of bribery or as centres of agitation and organisation of
political plots; the different sodales might work on different
’ tribes and divide their adherents into decuriae, the better to

keep an eye upon them and command their services. Thus

their proceedings might in some cases become dangerous to

tranquillity and social order, and accordingly the senatus con-
{N sultum of January B. C. 56 ut sodalitates decuri‘atzque di. ce-
ι der ent was directed against them; and those who resisted this

decree were made amenable to the lex de vi ’.121 It follows that
¹ sodalitates were no longer in existence at the time of the

xxxii

¹ 1¹⁸ Hence Cic. in the or. p.
Caelio ἓ 26 says of the Luper-
corum sodalitasy that it is fera

quaedam atque agrestis, quorum

hominum.. ad ambitionem gratio-
sissimorum tibi obligasti, C.

Fundani, Q. Galli, C. Corneli,
C. Orchivi: horum in causis ad

coitio illa silvestris ante est insti-

tuta quam humanitas atque lewes,
si quidem non modo nomina
deferunt inter se sodales, sed
etiam commemorant sodali-

tatem in accusando, ut ne
quis id forte nescidt timere
videantur.

119 Cf. or. p. Mur. ἓ 56 accusat
Ser. Sulpicius, sodalis filius,
cuius ingenio paterni omnes neces-
sarii munitiores esse debebant.

¹²⁰ Q. Cic. de pet. cons. ἓ ²9·
lzoc biennio quattuor sodalitates

te dferendzs quid tibi· eorum
sodales receperint et confir-
marint scio,· nam interfui.

121 Hence the passages where
Cicero mentions sodales, whose
raison d‘etre was being members of
a sodalitas, are either in speeches
delivered before B.C. 56 (as or. p.
Su11.§ 7, or. inVerr.11 §93) or
in writings where the usages of
an earlier period are spoken cf
(de orat. 11 ἓ 200, Brut. ἓ 166, de
nat. deor. 111 ἕ 80, ep ad fam.

xn 14, 7).
