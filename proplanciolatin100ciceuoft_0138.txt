70 ’ PRO CN. PLANCIO [VIII §20—

srequently spoken of by Cicero· in conjunction with C. Fabricius Lusci-
nus and M’. Curius Dentatus as a pattern of primitive Roman virtue
and simplicity (de sen. ἓ 43, de am. ἓ 18, §39‚ de nat: deor. 11 ἓ 165,
Brut. ἓ 55). According to Tacitus he was a native of Camerium (Ann.
XI 24), and Orelli (Onomast. p. 199) thinks that Cicero must have com-
mitted a σφάλμα μνημονικὸν in speaking os him as a Tusculan by birth,
though Ellendt imputes the error to Tacitus (n. on de orat. 111 §56),
while Wunder thinks that the Tusculans conferred the franchise on
him, as the burgesses of Tarentum did on Archias, see or. p. Arch.
ξ 5. Though only a novus lzomo (de sen. ἓ 15) he was promoted to all
the chief offices of state, to the consulship A. uc. 474=B·C· 280, when*
he crushed an insurrection in Etruria, the censorship in B.c. 270. In
B. C. 254 he was made pontifex maximus, being the first plebeian raised
to that dignity‚ and in Β. C. 246 he was appointed dicta'tor sor the pur·
pose of holding the comitia in the absence of the consuls. . Cicero often
praises him and speaks of him as one of those whose greatness was
owing to a special Providence, de nat. deor. 11 ἓ 165 quorum neminem
nisi iuvante deo talem fuisse credendum est. He is described as peritis-si-
mus pontifex (de domo ξ 139, cp. de nat. d. Ι ,ξ 115, 111 ἓ 5, de leg. 11
ἓ 53), as disertus (Brut. ἕ 55), and sapiens (de orat. 111 ἓ 56, ἓ 134); cp.
also or. p. Sull. ἓ 23.

1. 2. de tot Fulviis] 'The Fulvia gens was plebeian, but one of ¹

the most illustrious of the Roman gentes. The principal samilies in it
were those of Flaccus, Nobilior, Centumalus, Paetinus and Curvus. To
the last belonged L. Fulvius Curvus, who was the first of the gens who
rose to be consul, Β. C. 322. Cf. Plin. nat. hist. VII 43 est et L. Ful-
vius inter z‘nszjgm'a exempla .· nam Tusculanorum rebellantium consul
eodem honore cum transibat, exornatus est confestim a P. R. qui solus
eodem anno, quo fuerat hostis, triumphavit ex z’z‘s, quorum consul ficerat.

The last Fulvius who enjoyed a well-earned reputation scarcely
reached to Cicero's time, having been consul B.C. 125. He was the
first who subdued the Transalpine Ligurians, over whom he celebrated
a triumph 13.C. 123. Fulvia, the wife of Antonius, was the daughter
of M. Fulvius Bambalio, a member of this gens, hence Cic. (Phil. ΙΙΙ
ἓ 16), in reply to the taunt of Antonius that Octavian's mother was a
native of Aricia, says ‘si Aricinam uxorem non probas, cur probas
Tusculanam ,θ’ ’

1. 3. Arpinatem] native of Arpinum, which was an ancient
town of the Volscians to the east of Rome near the junction of the
Liris and Fibrenus (de legg. 11 5 3). It was taken from the Volscians
by the Samnites, and from them B. C. 305 by the Romans. In B. C. 302
it was made a municipium sine snſj'i‘agio, and it was not until A.U.C. 563
==B.c. 189 that, with Fundi and Formiae, it received the civitas, when
