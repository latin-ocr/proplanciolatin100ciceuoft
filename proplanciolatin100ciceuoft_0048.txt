Clustumina and Marcia, the last, in the expectation that it
would be rejected by the accused, which proved to be the case.
A decuria of senators was joined by as many equites and tribuni
aerarii. This would give, if none were excused or disqualffied,
from 90 to 108 iudices editicii. The number might be reduced
to 75, i. e. 25 out of each order, by challengeS. Thus P. Vatinius,

μ who was impeached under the lex Licinia before Cn. Plancius
2 was, had leave to challenge five jurors. In the case of Cn.

Plancius none were allowed to be set aside, perhaps because the
minimum number allowed by law had been already obtained.

of cases of sodalicia, the indictment according to the lex Licinia
might be laid before any praetor. It is possible that the parties
might agree among themselves asto the choice of a president,
as was permitted by the lex Vatinia. For it is questionable
whether otherwise Gaius Alfius Flavus, whom Cicero praises
so highly, would have been the iudex quaestionis in the trial of
Plancius, and that b the choice of Laterensis who was only
too ready to seize—upssffiinst his op·-
ponent. There were two suits about sodalicia in Β. C. 54, that
against Cn. Plancius before C. Alfius Flavus, a personal
friend of Cicero’s1⁵⁵‚ who was president of the quaestio de
maiestate in this year¹5⁶ and had shown himself gravis et firmus
as a judge in the trial of A. Gabinius, and that against Gaius
Messius, who had been tried before another praetor P. Ser-
vilius Isauricus¹⁵⁷, whom we know to have been president of a
special quaestio.

ξ 33. The penalty for a breach of the lex Licinia was the
same as that imposed for acts of violence (vis). In the case of
Cn. Plancius it was a question of salus, patria, fortunae158, i.e.
of perpetual banishment and of a fine proportioned in the litis
