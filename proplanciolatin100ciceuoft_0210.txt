1. 28. C. Fabricio] Gaius Fabricius Luscinus is also a popular
hero in Roman annals, as a representative of old-fashioned virtue. In
his first consulship 13.C. 282 he defeated the Samnites, Lucanians and
Bruttii, in Bc. 278 he had the conduct of the war against Pyrrhus,
which ended in that king evacuating Italy. He was censor in B.C. 27 5
and distinguished himself by the severity with which he set himself to
repress the growing taste sor luxury. On his celebrated embassy to
Pyrrhus see de off. 1 ξ 40, 111 ἓ 16, Tusc. 1 ἕ 110, 111 ἓξ 56, 57.

1. 29. C. Duilio] consul in B.C. 260 with Cn. Cornelius Scipio
Asina (l. 24). He was the man who first gained a naval victory over
the Carthaginians, the memory of which was perpetuated by the famous
columna rostrata, and, as a further reward, he was allowed the special
distinction of being accompanied, on his return from a banquet, by a
torch (funale), and a flute-player (tibicen), Liv. epit. 17, Cic. de sen.

A. Calatino] A. Atilius Regulus, of Calatia in Campania, hence
called Calatinus, was a distinguished Roman general in the first Punic
war, consul in B.C. 2 58, when he was honoured with a triumph for his
*victories over the Carthaginians in Sicily. He was consul a second
time in B.C. 2 54, when he captured Panormus, and in 13.C. 249 dictator,
being the first instance of a dictator commanding an army out of
Italy. Cicero classes him with the same worthies also in Tusc. 1§ 1 10 ;
cp. de nat. deor. 11 ἓ 165. His tomb on the via Appia outside the
Porta Capena close to that of the Scipios (Tusc. 1§ 13), contained the
following inscription 2—lmnc unum plurimae consentiunt gentes Ι populi

primarium fuisse virum, which is twice quoted by Cicero, de sen. §61,
de fin. 11§ 116. Cf. Valer. Max. 11 8, 2, Polyb. Ι 24.

Cn. et Ρ. Scipionibus] where two members of the same family
are mentioned. together and their names coupled by et, the plural
is regularly used by Cicero, from whom Drager hist. Synt. 1 p. 1 gives
several instances of the usage, and generally though not always in other
writers. The brothers Scipio [in the stemma Scipionum ἓ 33 l. 9,
n⁰ 5 and n⁰ 6] are frequently spoken of by Cic„ de off. 1 ξ 61, 111 ἓ 16,
de rep. 1 ἓ 1, de sen. ἓ 29, § 75, ἓ 82, or. p. Balb. ἓ 54, Tusc. 1 ἓ 89, de
nat. deor. 111 ἓ 80, parad. 1 ἓ 12. On Gnaeus, the younger, see above
l. 24. The elder, P. Cornelius Scipio, was consul in B.c. 218 in the
second Punic war, and after being defeated by Hannibal at the Ticinus
joined his brother in Spain, where, after winning some successes, they
both fell in battle.

1.³0. Africano] P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus maior, son
of the afore-mentioned P. Scipio (n0 8 in the stemma Scipionum ἓ 33
l. 9), consul in B.C. 205, the hero of the second Carthaginian war, in
