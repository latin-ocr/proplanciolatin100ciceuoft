M. T. CICERONIS DE OFFICIIS LIBRI TRES,

with Introduction, marginal Analysis and Commentary. Crown
8vo. Third Edition. 9s

“Dr Holden truiy states that ‘Text, Analysis, and Commentary in this third
edition have been again subjected to a thorough revision.' It is now certainly the
best edition extant. A sufficient apparatus of various readings is placed under the
text, and a very careful summary in the margin. The Introduction (after Heine)
and notes leave nothing to be desired in point of fulness‚ accuracy, and neatness ς the
typographical execution will satis-sy the most fastidious eye. A careful index of
twenty-four pages makes it easy to use the book as a storehouse os information on
points os grammar, history, and philosophy. . . . This edition of the Officez, Μι-
Reid's Academics, Laelius, and Cato, with the forthcoming editions of the De
Finibus and the De Natura Deorum will do much to maintain the study of Cicero’s
philosophy in Roger Ascham's university.¹’—N0tes and Queries.
