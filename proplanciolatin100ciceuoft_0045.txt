INTRODUCTION xli

nominated as liable to sit upon a particular quaestio, and this

number was reduced by ballot (sortitio) and by reiectiO, i. e. the =

challenging of them permitted to each of the contending parties,
to an aggregate of 75 at most or 25 out of each estate.

The voting of the iudices was originally open, but after the
passing ,of the bill of L. Cassius Longius Rauilla (lex
Cassia tabellaria148) in B.C. 137 it was conducted in secret by
ballot (per tabellas), each juror depositing his tabella in one of
three boxes (sitella) according to the estate to which he belonged
in pursuance of the lex Fufia iudiciaria149. It was necessary
that at least two-thirds of the iudices should be present and
vote.

§29. Besides these enactments the bill of P. Vatinius
(lex Vatinia de alternis consiliis reiciendis) was still valid in
B. C. 54, by which according to Ernesti and others the accused
(reus) in a trial could challenge (reicere) all the iudices and con-
silia once and the prosecutor (accusator) could do the same—the
previous practice having been that each party, prosecutor and
defendant, could only challenge a certain number of the con-
silium, the places of those who were challenged being supplied
by the praetor's subsortitio, But C. T. Zumpt supposes that
this law allowed either party tochallenge the consilia once and
that on this being done a new consilium was appointed: but
that it did not allow the whole consilium to be challenged
twice, as Ernesti supposed, first by the accused and then by the
prosecutor.
