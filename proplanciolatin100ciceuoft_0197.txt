Already in ἓ 49 Cicero had denied the possibility of the coz'lzo and cor·
ruptio, which was assumed and asserted by Laterensis, by a reference to
the sudden and unexpected commencement of the first election‚ here he
does it by a glauce at the majority necessary to both, if they were to be
elected at all. We infer from this, that Lat. had asserted there was
bribery (ι) because Plancius had been elected in the first and second
comitia, (2) because (α) Plotius had the votes of the majority of the
tribes, (b) because both had an almost exactly equal number of votes in
one of the tribes, (c) because both the tribes, whose votes had been
promised by Plotius to Pedius and by Plancius to Laterensis, had at the
last comitia fallen off and voted sor Plancius and Plotius. An introduces
