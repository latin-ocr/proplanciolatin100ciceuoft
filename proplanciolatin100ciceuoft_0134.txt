CHAPTER VIII

§la 1. 15. municipio antiquissimo Tusculano] ‘The legend
which ascribes the foundation of Tusculum to Telegonus, the son of
Circe and Ulysses, is familiar to all readers of the Latin poets (factaque
Telegoni moenia celsa manu Ovid Fast. 111 91, Circaeo Tuscula dorso
moenia Sil. Ital. V11 692, Telegoni pulsatos ariete muros ib. XII 535,
vitreae iuga perfida Circes Dulichiis ululata lupis Stat. Silv. 1 3, 83,
Telegoni iuga parricidae Hor. Od. 111 29, 8, Epod. Ι 30)....In the time
of the Latin league, from the fall of Alba to the battle of the lake
Regillus, Tusculum was the most prominent town in Latium. It
suffered, like the other towns in Latium, a complete eclipse during the
later Republic and the Imperial times.’ Burri Rome and the Campagna
p. 380 f. It became a municipium cum stff‘ogio soon after B.C. 381
(Liv. VI 26), before which time it had the civitas sine suffugio, and its
inhabitants (municipes) were enrolled in the Tribus Papiria, Liv. VIII
37, 12, Val. Max. IX 10, 1, Papiria tribus, in qua plurimum postea
Tusculani in civitatem recepti potuerunt, neminem umquam candi-
datum Polliae tribus fecit magistratum, Ramsay Rom. Ant. p. 91.
Tusculum was remarkable for the steadiness of its friendship for
Rome, which was only interrupted in B.C. 379, when in consequence
of a number of Tusculans being found amongst the prisoners in the
Volscian campaign, war was declared and Camillus sent against the
city. Cicero had a villa there (Tusculanum) from which his Tusculan
disputations take their name.

Max. 111 4 §6.—Iuvent1a] according to the statement of L. Cassius
(ξ 58), who united with M. Juventius Laterensis in accusing Cn. Plancius,
the first plebeian aedile was a member of this gens. Cicero denied the
correctness of the statement, but, true or not, the fact cf its being made
is sufficient to prove the antiquity of the gens. The name does not
occur again in history till B.C. 194 when T. Juventius Thalna was made
praetor ; and the first of the gens who obtained the consulship was
M. Juventius Thalna, who was the colleague of Tib. Sempronius
Gracchus B.C. 163 (Liv. XLIII 10, XLV 14). The family names of the
gens are Celsus, Laterensis, Pedo, Thalna. Smith‘Dict. Biogr. 11

1. 18. praefectura, as distinguished from an ordinary colonia or
municzpium, was an Italian city governed by an officer nominated by
the praetor urbanus and sent annually from Rome to administer justice
(praejectus iuri dicundo). Festus p. 233 Miiller: ‘praefecturae eae
appellabantur in Italia in quibus et ius dicebatur et nundinae agebantur*
