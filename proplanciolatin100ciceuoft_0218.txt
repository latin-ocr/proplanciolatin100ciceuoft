cessit postea Puteola num, qnod municipium Graecum antea Δικαιαρχία

“ vocitatum est. Unde Lucilius ‘Inde Di ca rclz eu m populos Delumque

minorem.’ Statius Silv. 111 5, 75 speaks ofDicarclzaeiportus et litora
mundo hospita. Cf. Madv. ad Cic. de fin. 11 ἓ 83 p. ¹281.

1. 28. at ego cum—venissem, cum—solent. osse, concidi paene
cum ex me quidam quaesisset] Observe that in this passage cum
venissem is the historical protasis to concidi, while cum solent merely
explains the time implied in iis diebus, Zumpt Gr. ἕ 579 note.

1. 29. lautissimi] ⁴ the fashionable world.’ lautus is properly
‘ washed‚’ ‘ bathed‚’ hence transl. ⁴ elegant‚’ ‘ sumptuous‚’ ‘ rich,'
‘ grand‚’ Iuv. Sat. XI 1, Atticus eximie sz‘ cenat, lautus habetur.

1. 30. concidi paene] ‘ Ι thought I should have sunk to the earth,
when I was asked on what day I had left Rome and whether there
was any news there‚’ so great was the shock to my pride, my dis-
comfiture‚ at not receiving the congratulations I expected.

1. 31. num quidnam—novi] ξ 55 n.

1. 33. etiam me hercule] An expression like our ‘oh yeS, to be
sure‚’ and the German ‘ja so! ' as if he were reminded of something
he had forgotten. Cf. Hand Turs. 11 p. 568, Nagelsb. lat. Stil. p. 236.
It is often used by Cicero at the end of a letter, as ep. ad Att. 1 13, 6
novi tibi quidnam scribam? quid? etiam, i.e. estne aliquid? est

1. 1. fastidiose] ‘disdainfully.‘
immo] n. to ἓ 33 1. 33, Zumpt Gr. ἓ 277.

1. 2. quasi qul omnia sciret] ‘ who pretended to know everything,’
but who did not know that Cicero had held the quaestorship of the
division of Lilybaeum and not that of Syracuse. The double quaestor-
ship in Sicily (Verr. 11 2 ξ ιι) is probably to be accounted for by the
gradual acquisition of the island by the Romans, the western part
having been ceded by Carthage in B.c. 241, the eastern remaining
unconquered until B.c. 210. When the entire island became a province.
a second quaestorship was founded because of its importance as one
of the chief sources of their supply of corn, in the district of Syracuse,
that established over the district of Lilybaeum still remaining. See
Mr Heitland‘s note to Div. in Q. Caec. § 2.

ἓ 1ὀ3. qiud muita] sc. dicam, ‘to cut my story short,’ Kenn. Gr.
