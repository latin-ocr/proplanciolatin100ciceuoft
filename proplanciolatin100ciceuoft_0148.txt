1. 5. an Minturnenses —mlrarist an goes with miraris, the anti·
thesis (llffz'nturnenses coloni—versantur), which serves as a foil to bring
out the thought and which we should bring in as a subordinate clause
by ‘while‚' ‘whereas‚’ being coordinated as a main clause; just as in
. Greek such antitheses are regularly introduced by μέν and δέ (Buttmann
Gr. Gr. p. 396 ed. 1833). See Madv, Gr. §438hmy n. to de off. 1
ἓ 1 14 1. 17 and cp. below§ 41 l. 32 n. The train of thought is as follows:
‘ or is it the case that, while vthe people of Minturnae are immortalised
for affording shelter to Marius in his exile, you are surprised at Plancius
being honoured as he was for the protection he accorded me?' ‘Iam
narratum a me hoc exemplum plenissime scio de C. Mario, qui Sullanis
armis cedens cum filio in Minturnensium paludibus latuit. Inde emissus,
quoniam non potuisset occidi, navigio impositus in Africam pervectus
ad usque dirutae Kartaginis fines. Inde armis Cinnanis in Italiam resti-
tutus, et adeptus denique septimum consulatum.’ SCHOL. AMBR.

Minturnenses] the people of Minturnae, which was a city of
Latium, on the via Appia, on the right bank of the Liris, on the borders
of an extensive marsh, about three miles from the sea (Strab. v. p. 233).
A colonia maritima with the rights of Roman citizens was established
there in B.c. 296 (Liv. Χ 21, Vell. Pat. 1 14). In .B.C. 88 C. Marius,
when flying from Rome by sea, was compelled to put in at the mouth of
the Liris, and, endeavouring to conceal himself in the marshes, was
dragged srom thence and imprisoned by order of the magistrates of
Minturnae, who however afterwards released him and put him on
board a ship which conveyed him to Africa. Cf. or. p. Sest. ξ 50 memi-
