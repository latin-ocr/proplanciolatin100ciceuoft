in the second consulship of Pompeius and Crassus, he became
a candidate for the aedileship for the following year, B.C. 54.
It has been already stated (p. xv) that the elections were not
completed in this year⁴²4 but postponed till the following in
consequence of some protest. His competitors were A. Plo-
ti·us4⁵‚ Q. Pedius and Μ. Juventius Laterensis4⁶; he was
elected together with A. Plotius to hold the public gameS, as
curule aedile4⁷‚ for the remainder of the year. At his election
he was supported by the hearty co-operation of his friends and
townsmen3 the friendship of Cicero and the social influence of
his father were also a considerable help to him. The two
tribes Teretina4⁸ and Voltiniam were interested in his behalf
because of his birthplace. It was not surprising that Laterensis
f failed, for relying on his high birth and social rank he had taken

ς’ little or no trouble›to secure his election. At first C. Plancius,

ι’ it appearS‚ wished for him as his colleague in the aedileship‚
since at the first comitia in B.C. 55 he seems to have obtained

² for him the votes of the tribes that were friendly to himself.

But owing to the indifference shown by Laterensis in his canvass
Cn. Plancius abandoned all hope of serving him, and as he ran
the risk of losing his own election by supporting such an un-
popular rival, he effected a coalition with A. Plotius at the
second comitia and was ultimately chosen aedile with him50.
