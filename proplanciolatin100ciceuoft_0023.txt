he exhibited games at praenestem, and afterwards served as
proquaestor in Cyrene. In B. C. 59 he became a candidate for
the tribuneship, but withdrew from his candidateship‚ amid the
applause of the conservative party, because he refused in his
candidatorial speech (oratio in toga candz'da)⁵⁷ to bind himself
by an oath prescribed to all magistrates to observe Caesar’s
1aw⁵8 respecting the distribution of the public land in Campania.
He was denounced by L. Vettius in B.C. 59 as an accessory and
privy to a conspiracy against Gnaeus Pompeius⁶9‚ and he ac-

et de republica cogitans. When Cicero went into exile in
Β. C. 58, Laterensis felt alwarm sympathy for him⁶0 and showed

the optimate party. His partisanship made him unpopular and
his democratic adversaries watched their opportunity to raise
suspicion against him. In his dissatisfaction at the course of
events he withdrew from public life and was consequently for-
gotten even by the members of his own party. When then
in Β, C. 55 and 54, in the second consulship of Pompeius and
Crassus, he became a candidate for the curule aedileship‚ he could
not fail to perceive that he had little or no chance of successffl.
Plancius wished for him as a colleague, until he saw that his own
prospects might possibly be injured by his support of Laterensis,
It was not until the year 51 B.C. that he recovered lost ground
and obtained sufficient popularity to be elected praetor θ’.

He appears once more in history as a legatus in the
army of M. Aemilius Lepidus, governor of the provinces of

Hispania citerior and Gallia Cisalpina in B.C. 43. When An· ¹
tonius came to Gaul after the battle of Mutina, Laterensis tried in }

soon as Lepidus threw open the gates of the camp to the victor,
