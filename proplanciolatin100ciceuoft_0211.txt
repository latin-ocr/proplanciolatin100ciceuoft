Marcello] M. Claudius M. F. Marcellus, celebrated as five times
consul and the conqueror of Syracuse (3.0. 212, Siculae victor telluris
Prop. IV 18, 33), who slew Viridomarus, king of the Insubres, a Gallie
tribe, with his own hand (Tusc. lv ἓ 49), and gained the third and last
spolia opima which were obtained in Rome (13.0. 2²3· Plutarch Marc.
c. 6, Aurel. Viet. de vir. ill. c. 45). He was slain at Venusia in the
eleventh year of the second Punic war (13.C. 208, Tusc. 1 ἓ 89) under
circumstances which compelled even Hannibal, his greatest enemy, to
bury him with military honours, interitmn eius ne crudelissimus quidem

Maximo] Q. Fabius Maximus Verrucosus Ovicula, another
hero of the second Punic war, surnamed Cunctator, because he
refused to engage in action with Hannibal but endeavoured to weary
him out by delays. See de off. 1 ἓ 81, ἓ 128.

Ρ. 25, 1. 1. octingenti fere] From the year of the city 245 to the
year of this speech 700 there are 455 years. Had there always been
consuls, there would have been 910 of them in this period, not including
the consules suffecti. But the number is diminished by one year in
which the decemviri hindered the electiori of consuls, by fifty years in
which tribuni militum consulari potestate were in power, by five years
in which there were solitudines magistratuum, and by three years in
which a Dictator and a magister equitum without consuls held the
supreme power (A.U.C. 430, 445, 453). Accordingly we must make
a deductiori of at least 118 consuls for these fifty-nine years; there
remain then 79² (octingenti sere), among whom there were certainly
more chosen‚ while others again were replaced by suffecti.

1. 2. reperies] Madvig opusc. acad. 11 p. 36 n. points out that this
and not Wunder’s reppereris nor Klotz’s reperis is the right reading.
