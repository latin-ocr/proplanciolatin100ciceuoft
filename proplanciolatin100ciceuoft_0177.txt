justly observes that‘ the Greeks make this far plainer than the Ι atius Β
by their μέν,’ not always however as in one remarkable instance,
which he quotes, S. Paul Rom. VI 17 χαρις δὲ τῷ θεῷ ὅτι δοῦλοι ἦτε

clarissimi cives—non tulerunt] ‘adhuc eandem, quantum rebus
ipsis apparet, inculcat iniquitatem iudicii, quod Laterensis ut ex editiciis
haberet maxime laboraverat. Et hac in parte commemorationem
videtur facere Tullius eius temporis quo Ser—’ SCHOL. AMBR. If the
scholiast wrote, as is probable, Servius Sulpicius, he may allude to
what Cic. says of Sulpicius and the editicii iudices or ‘ special jury’
in or. p. Mur. c. 23 ξ 46 ff, where he is referring to some lex which
was not carried, by which there were to be 12 5 iurors, equites and
tribuni aerarii, nominated by the accuser from the register (album
iudicum), 75 of whom might be rejected by the reus, leaving 50; also
25 senators were to be appointed, but by some other means, none of
whom could be rejected, so that the jury would eonsist in all of 75.
Even this law, says Cic., was resisted. See Introd. ξ 17.

1. 3. ex omn-i populo] because any sour tribes might be named by
the prosecutor, of whom the accused could reject one and the jury were
chosen out of the remaining three ; hence they are said to be ab accusa-
tore constz‘tutz', though it does not appear how they were appointed,
probably by lot.

§4² neque ego nunc—putarem] ‘ not that Ι am now complaining
of the unfairness of the law, but Ι am trying to prove that your proceed-
ing (in naming the tribes) did not accord with its spirit, and—if you
had managed that harsh form of trial according to the vote of the
senate and the decree of the people, by naming both the tribe to
which the accused belonged and those which he cultivated— —so far from
' complaining, Ι should rather look upon him as virtually acquitted, by
the npmination of zudices to try his case, who might also be witnesses
in it.’
