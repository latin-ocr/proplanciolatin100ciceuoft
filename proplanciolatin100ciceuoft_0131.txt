v11§ 17] NOTES 63

stronger body of supportem, not only srom his own prefecture Atina,
than Laterensis had from Tusculum—the burgesses of which place are
sewer in number and take less pride in the success of their fellow·towns·
men (§§19—-21)—-—but also from the neighbouring municipia, who were
his staunch friends and showed the liveliest interest in his electi0n‚
as they do in the result of the present trial (ἓ 22). Another thing which
told in Plancius' favour was that his father was a man of great weight
among the publicani, of which highly influential body he was a leading
member, and they were very zealous about his election (§§ 2 3, 24). Ι
myself also, out of gratitude for his inestimable services to me, used all
the influence Ι could possibly command in his behalf (§§ 25, 26).
Last1y‚ you ought not to be surprised at the election of Plancius, when
his private character exhibits so many excellent traits and he is per-
sonally held in such esteem and so beloved by all those with whom he
has had any official connexion. In point of birth, I consess, he may be
inferior to you, but there are some points in which he is your superior,
while in integrity and other virtues he is at least your equal (§§ 27—30).
