1. 32. 1.. Racflfl] Lucius Racilius was a warm supportet of
Cicero. He was tribune of the plebs in B-C. 56=A.u.c. 697, with Cn.
Plancius as his colleague. He took part in the disorders which arose
when Clodius, accused by Milo de vi, sought to get rid of the charge by
becoming a candidate sor the aedileship. The question was debated in
the senate, and in the forum sought to be decided by open force, whether
the trial should come on first or the election of aediles, or vice versa.
Milo had now retired into private life: the consuls were gone to their
provinces3 P. Rutilius Lupus, a tribune of the people, summoned a
meeting of the senate: only about 200 members attended. Racilius
renewed the debate about Milo’s impeachment of Clodius, and called
upon Lentulus Marcellinus the consul designate to give his opinion
upon it: who proposed that in the first place an allotment of judices
should be made for the trial and after that the election of aediles, and
that if any one attempted to hinder the trial, he should be deemed a
public, enemy. The tribunes C. Cato and C. Cassius spoke against it,
and were for proceeding to an election before any step towards a trial.
L. Philippus, the other consul elect, was of the same mind as his col-
league, and Cic. being called upon to speak denounced Clodius3 he
was followed by others. Clodius began to speak with the intention of
wasting the rest of the day (diem dicendo eximere coepit) 3 the rabble of
his followers outside expressed their opinions so loudly, that the senate
broke up in a hurry. In the civil war Racilius espoused Caesar's
party and was with his army in Spain in B.c. 48. There he entered
into the conspiracy formed against the life of Q. Cassius Longinus, the
governor of that province, by whom he was put to death with the rest
of the conspirators. Smith Dict. Biogr. vol. 111 p. ‚640-
