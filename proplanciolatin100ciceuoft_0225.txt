1. 25. Calidium] Q. Calidius. father of the orator, was tr. pl. in
B.C. 99=A. U.C. 655, and carried a law in this year sor the recall of Q.
Metellus Numidicus from banishment, in gratitude sor which the son
Metellus Pius, when consul, supported him in his candidature sor the
praetorship. He was praetor urbanus in 13.C. 79, praetor of Spain in
B.C. 78. On his return to Rome from his province he was accused in
the quaeste'o de repetundis by Q. Lollius and found guilty in 13.C. 77
(Verr. 1 558, 11 3 563).

Q. Metellus] Q. Caecilius Metellus C. f. Numidicus, the
most distinguished of the family of the Metelli, hence generally called
Metellus ille Ν. by Cic. as or. p. Sest. ἓ 130‚ or. p. Arch. ἓ 6, was consul
B.C. 109=A. U.C. 646 (Brut. ἓ 135) with M. Junius Silanus, when he con-
ducted the war against Jugurtha in Numidia, as he did also in the fol-
lowing years as proconsul, with success. On the cause of his return to Rome
before· the conclusion of the war see Cic. de off. 111 ἓ 79 with my note.
In B.c. 100 the demagogue Saturninus carried his agrarian law, which
contained a clause that the senate should swear obedience to its pro-
visions within five days after its enactment. Metellus refused to take
the oath‚ and, when Saturninus brought forward a bill to punish him
with exile,voluntarily quitted the city, rather than risk disturbances in it,
(cum in eam legem, quam non iure rogatam indicarat, iurare unusne-
luisset, de civitate maluit quam de sententia demoverz). On the death of
Saturninus and the consequent dissolution of his party very little oppo-
sition was offered to his recall, which was proposed in B.C. 99, tribunicia
rogatione, interfhctis inimicis, nulla auctoritate senatus restitutus est, or.

Q. Calidius propter sua in rem p. merita non id sunt consecuti, ut

CHAPTER XXIX

1. 29. Q. Metellum] Q. Metellus, son of Numidicus, surnamed
Pius, because of the devoted affection which he manifested sor his
father, when he besought the people to recall him in 13.C. 99 (de or.
11 ἓ 167). He was praetor in B.C. 87 and took an active part in the
Social War. When Marius landed in Italy and joined the consul Cinna,
