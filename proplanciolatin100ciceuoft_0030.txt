f. Laws relating to ambitus

ξ 16. The oldest laws relating to ambitus do not apply to
largitio. Thus the earliest enactment, of which we have men-
tion (B.C. 432), simply forbade persons to add white to their
dress with a view to an election94. ‘This seems to mean’ says
Long ‘using some white sign or token on the dress to signify
that a man was a candidate. The object of the law was to
check canvassing (ambitio) ⁹⁵! The next enactment was the lex
Poetelia (Β. C. 358), which forbade ¹candidates to carry on their
canvass anywhere but in the Forum and Campus Martiusffl. It
was passed, Livy tells us, mainly to check the pretentions of
novi homines, of whom the nobiles were jealous. But the grow-

⁹³ Cic. refers to the intrigues of
Gaius Verres with the divisores

noctu ad istum vocatos ...... continuo
(Verrem) esse pollicitum quantam
vellent pecuniam, si me aedilitate
deiecissent. There is a story told
by Cicero de harusp. resp. ἓ 42 of
Clodius that, when acting as se-
quester, he killed the divisores,
who were staying in his house,
in order to appropriate the money
held in trust from them: di i-
sores omnium tribuum domi zple
suae crudelissima morte mactavtt.

nihil est aliud quam intempestiva
captatio gratiae ac favoris, plerum-
que ffcax, ut eius ergo ius et
officium migremus.
