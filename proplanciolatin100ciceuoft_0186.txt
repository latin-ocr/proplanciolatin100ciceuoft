118 PRO CN. PLANCIO [XX §49

CIIAPTER XX

ἓξ 49--50. But the election of Plancius to the aedileship was
already a settled matter in the former year, when the Comitia were
attempted to be held, but sor some reason postponat, when there was no
possibility (ff Plancius employing bribery and corruption, even if he had
thought of doing· so, because so short a notice was given by the presiding·
officers os the election, and, as the vote of the centuria which votes first
determines the votes of those which come aster, so Plancius’ prior election
made his second election sure. T hough Laterensis, had he stooped to
make himsetf popular with the electors, might even then, in the interval
between the two elections, have influenced them to vote jor himself.

§49‚ 1. 28. Sed cur 810 ago? quasi cet] we might- also punc-
tuate thus: sed cur sic ago quasi cet. We have an instance of quasi
serving as a correlative to sic in de sen. ἕ 26 litteras Graecas—sic avide
arripui quasi diuturnam sitim explere cupiens ; where ita would be
more usually employed. ‘Nexus orationis hic est,’ says Wunder,
‘conprobare Cicero c. XIX volebat, Plancium suffragia tribuum, quas
tulisset, non largitione devinxisse. Id nunc negat demonstrandum a
se esse propterea quod priora comitia, in quibus Plancius aedilis sit
designatus, eo modo sint habita, ut nullo pacto tribus corrumpi potu-
erint.'

comitiis superioribus] ‘Intellegenda sunt ea, quae a. 699 Cn.
Pompeio 11 M. Licinio Crasso coss. haben coepta, set propter obnun-
tiationem absoluta non sunt.’ W. See Intr. ἕ 3.

1. 30. consul] M. Licinius Crassus, the very man who had
carried the lex Licinia de sodaliciis (ἓ 36), and who certainly would not
be likely to ha've connived at a breach of his own law at the election
over which he himself presided.

consul—summa auctoritate] abl. description or characteristic of
quality, Kenn. Gr. p. 399§ 153, Roby Gr. 11 1232. =

1. 31. habere coepit subito ceu] ‘he determined so suddenly and
unexpectedly to hold the election that no one had time given him
to make the necessary provisions, even if he had thought of bribing.’

1. 33. comparandi] ‘ for getting ready‚’ as in Liv. XXXV 45, 5 ut
Romani tempus ad compara ndum habeant, XLII 52, 8 fizllaci colloquio
extractam hiemem ut tempus ad comparandum haberent, Corn. Nep.
T hrasyb. 11 2 tempore ad comparandum dato.

1⁵. 20, 1. 1. diribltae tabellae] ‘the votes were sorted‚' ξ 14 l. 2 5.
The word tabellae is a conjectural addition of Wunder's, adopted by
Baiter, Kayser, Hirschfelder. He objects to diribitae tribus in the
sense ‘the votes of the tribes were distributed.' He proposes at the
same time to erase renuntiatae as a term inapplicable to tabellae and
because it disturbs the symmetry of the sentence. See ἓ 14 1. 26.
