5 ¹79, 1. 2⁷. meis ponderibus examinabo] ‘ I shall weigh them in
my own scale,’ lit. ‘ with my own weights.’ Examinare is from examen
(ex, ago), ‘the tongue of a balance' (trutina), ‘the index of a steel-
yard,' hence the phrase paribus exa minatus ponderibus ‘in a state
of equilibrium,' Tusc. 1 ἕ 43. Cf. Verg. Aen. XII 725, Pers. Sat. 1 6
examenque improbum in illa castiges trutina, ⁴ correct the lying
tongue in that balance of theirs. ’

1. 29. tempus] ‘ exigency‚' cf. ἓ 1 l. 5, ἓ 41. 27, ἓ 301. 30.

CHAPTER XXXIII

agitur studium tuum] ‘you are concerned about nothing more
than a triumph over Laterensis, or if you insist upon it-f-about some&
thing greater—your public reputation and the credit of being an aedile z
Plancius on the other hand is in danger of losing his civil status, his
country, his fortune: By studium tuum is meant as Wunder expresses
it ‘ vehemens Laterensis cupiditas vincendi in soro eum, a quo in campo
victus est’ and by agitur studium tuum ‘expletur studium tuum, si
Planci caussam deserens ego tecum efficio ut condempnetur, aut non
expletur, si Planci causam agens efficio ut absolvatur.' By agitur
elertz’matz‘o tua is meant ‘amittis bonam de te samam, si absolvitur
Plancius, aut retines, si condempnatur-²

1. 30. 81 vis] cf. de fin. 11 ἓ ¹4 hanc quoque iucunditatem, si vis,
transfi’r in animum, 11 ἓ 89 in voluptate corporis (addam, si vis,
animi), de div. 11 ξ 34 concedam hoc z'Jsssum, sz‘ vis.

laus aedilitatis] according to Garatoni and Orelli this is an
appropriate expression, because, if Plancius were convicted of bribery,
Laterensis would succeed to the aedileship. Wunder however objects
that there is no evidence to support such an opinion: he omits aedili·
tatis.

1. 32. distineor et. divellor] ‘I find myself in a painful state of
distraction‚’ Germ. 2·ch bcfinde mz'clz in ez‘nem schmerzliclzen sz'cspalte,

ἓ 50 nec divelli nec distrahi.

1. 33. 111 causa. dispari] ‘in a case of such disparity,' because
Plancius had everything to lose by conviction, Laterensis nothing to
incur but the disappointment of his studium, cf. de off. 11 ξ 61 l. 8.
