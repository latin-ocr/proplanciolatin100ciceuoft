Laterensis asserted that Plancius' services during his tribunate had
not equalled those 0] Racilius, who therefore deserved greater gratitude
from Cicero. Cicero says in reply, that he wishes the Roman people had
not been preventcd by the violence eff some men from making Racilius a
proper return for his services to himself, with which he professes himself
well *satisfieri and that he had 770 777771 of Plancius’ further aid aster
he had already saved his life. A gain, how could he help showing his
gratitude to one whom the senate had especially thanked on his behalf?
T herc is nothing he would not have done for Late7enszs‚ if the occasion
had offered, bnt he has so many benesactms that he is puzzled how to
reconczle their confli’ctzng claims to his gratanda and fiars he can sca7 cely
show himself grateful to all at the 3777777 time. ln the present case,
howeve7, whe7e the disparity is 30 g7 eat, his duty is plain: Laterensis
had but little to gain by succeeding, he> merely longed to efface his defeat
for the aedileship, whereas Plancius would lose everything by conviction.
Later en 373 cannot suppose that the comt well be prej'udzeed against Cicero
on the g7ound of 1773 erring¹ on the 37717 of excess in this g7 atitude, for if
gratz'tude be, as it is, the foundatzon of all virtues, then excess 777 zt can
be no reproach. Α3 70 Late7ensis’ expression that the ju7 ors are not
persons likely to run the rzsh 0] 77 trzal nor fond os letzgatwn, it ought
not, says Cicero, to have any weight wilh the jurors to make them care
little about his gratitude, as if it could only be shown to those who needed
his professional services. (ξ '7'7—§ 82.)

Cicero replies‚ partly in jest, partly in earnest, to three trifling im-
putations of Laterensis, (1) that he =is too fhnd 0] making pathetic
appeals to the jury, (2) of appearing as counsel in defi’nce, (3) 0] sayz'ng
smart things and making poor johes. (ἓ 83-85.)

Cicero vindicates his hasty departure from Rome against the insinu-
ations of Laterensis. It was not the sear 0] death which drove him into
exile, but the apprehension 0] civil war and 0] the trouble which might
have befallen patriotic citizens had he remained in Rome. He did not
wish to deprive the state of its mainstay nor the senate and people of
the opportunity 0] setting an example 0] 77 zig 070773 exercise 0] power
and display ofg ‹rratitude by his 7estoration ]70777 exile. (ἓ 86—§ 90.)

Late7enszs taxes Cice7o with havingfcnfeited his 'liberty 0] α777’077,
Cicero denies that he has. No one can blame hzm, he says, if he has
regard sometimes for his own sajety, when he has done so much sor the
sasety os others. If he no longer opposes his former enemies it does not
fillow that he deserves to be twittea' with political inconsistency. because
he accommodates himself to the changing circumstances and conditions os
society. The good of the state is the standard by which every statesman
