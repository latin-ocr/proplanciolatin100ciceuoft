CHAPTER XVI

ἕΒΒ, 1. 33. tu autem] Such was the intention of the senate in
passing this law: but you, Laterensis, disregarded the spirit of the
law by 'nominating different tribes from those which you were expected
to nommate.

Ρ. 16, 1. 1. Teretinam] one of the 35 tribes into which the whole
free Roman population was divided after Β. C. 241, each tribe occupying
a district called regio. Of these four were city tribes (tribus urbanae),
named aster their respective regiones, Collina, Esquilina, Palatina,
Suburrana ; of the remaining thirty-one country tribes or wards
(rusticae) sixteen belonged to Rome since the conquest of Porsenna.
These were named Aemilia, Camilia, Claudia, Cornelia, Fabia, Galeria,
Horatia, Lemonia, Menenia, Papiria, Pollia, Pupinia, Romilia, Sergia,
Veturia (Voturia), Voltinia. The above names are formed, it will be
seen, srom the names of clans, and are not like those of the districts
added at a later period derived from the localities (Mommsen Hist. of
R. 1 p. 39). In B.C. 504 the tribe was formed, which was afterwards
designated Crustumina. In B.C. 387 four new tribes were formed in
the territoxies of Veii, Capena, and Falerii, called respectively Arniensis,
Sabatina, Stellatina, Tromentina (Liv. VI 5, 8), making in all twenty.
In B.C. 358 two more were added, the Pomptina and Publilia, in the
Volscian and Campanian territories (Liv. VII 15, 12); in B.C. 332 two
more, Maecia and Scaptia, out of the territory of the Hernicans; in B.C.
318 the Oufentina and Falerna (Liv. IX 20, 6) ; in B.C. 299 the Aniensis
and Teretina (Liv. Χ 9, 14); and lastly in B.C. 241 the Quirina and
