ξ 13] NOTES 57

G. fimbriam] Gaius Flavius Fimbria, a novus homo, i.e.
the first of his family to obtain a curule office, was colleague of C. Marius
in his second consulship A.U.c. 650=B.C. 104 (Verr. V. §181). We
learn from §21 that he had previously been an unsuccesssul candidate
sor the tribuneship. In the revolt of Saturninus he took up arms sor
the protection of the state (or. p. Rab. perd. ἓ 21). His activity in
the capacity of a iudex is spoken of de off. 111§=77. He was himself
accused by Gratidius of repetundae and acquitted, although M. Aemilius
Scaurus appeared as witness against him (or. p. Font. ἓ 24, Valer.
Max. VIII 5 ξπ). As a speaker he was considered (Brut. §129) tru-
culentus, asper, maledicus, paulo fervidior atque commotior, diligentia
tamen et virtute animi atque vita bonus auctor in senatu.

1. 33. Gn. Manlium] Cn. Manlius or Mallius Maximus was
consul Β. c. 105 with Q. Servilius Caepio. On his return from his pro-
vince, Transalpine Gaul, where he was utterly defeated by the Boian
Gauls, he was impeached and defended by M. Antonius, the celebrated
orator (de orat. II § 125).

L 3. et quo plus—aberat. ame] i.e. et quo plus intererat me
tua frui virtute, eo minus me virtute tua adiuvisti, ‘the
more it was for my interest to have the benefit of your services, the
more they sailed me.' Keil explains: et quo plus mea intererat
talem virum oculis videre, eo plus mihi defuit tum cum
adspectu tuo erat carendum. Abesse is here used in the opposite
sense to adesse when it means ‘to be present with one’s aid,’ ‘appear
on a person's behalf,’ ‘to stand by,’ cp. or. p. Sulla ἓ 7 quidest quod
