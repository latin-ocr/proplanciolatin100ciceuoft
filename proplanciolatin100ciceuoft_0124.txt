56 PRO CN. PLANCIO [V§12-

votion to philosophy de orat. 1 §104, de nat. deor. 1 ξ 16. When
consul (B.C. 61) he had given offence to Cicero by protecting Clodius
after his violation of the mysteries of the Bona dea. The analysis of
his character which Cic. gives in his letter to Att. 1 13, 3 forms an
amusing contrast to the terms in which he is spoken of here: consul
ipse parvo animo et pravo, tantum cavillator genere illo moroso, quod
etiam sine dicacitate ridetur, facie magis quam facetiis ridiculus (‘ he
makes people laugh not by the soree of his expression but by the ex-
pression of his face’), nihil agens cum re p., seiunctus ab optimatibus, a
quo nihil speres boni rei publicae, quia non vult ; nihil metuas mali,
quia non audet.

1. 29. Q. Catulo] Q. Lutatius Q. F. Catulus. the father, who
was the colleague of Marius in his fourth consulship, Β. C. 102, and
gained a victory with him over the Cimbri near Vercellae: he was
included in the Marian proscription B. C. 87, and, escape being impos-
sible, put an end to his life (de orat. 111 §9⁷ de nat. d. 111 §80, Tusc.
v. §56). He is frequently spoken of by Cicero with praise, or. p.
Rabir. perd. § 21 Catulus pater, in quo summa sapientia, eximia
virtus, singularis humanitas fuit, or. p. Fonteio 5 33. He was an ac-
complished Greek scholar, and famed for the grace and purity with
which he wrote his own language (de orat. 11 ἓ 28, 111 ἓ 29, Brut. ξ 132)
multae litterae, summa non vitae solum alque naturae, sed orationis etiam
comitas, incorrupta quaedam· Latini sermonis integritas .· quae perspici
cum ex orationibus eius potest, tum facillime ex eo libro, quem de con-
sulatu et de rebus gestis suis conscripsit molli et Xenophonteo genere ser-
monis, ib. §2 59. He is introduced in the de oratore, as accompanying
his half-brother C. Julius Caesar Strabo (ἓ 108 1. 5) to the Tusculanum
of Crassus. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the consulship three
times, being defeated first by C. Atilius Serranus A. U. 648=B.C. 106,
the year of Cicero’s birth3 secondly by Cn. Manlius A. U. 649=B.c. 105,
cf. or. p. Mur. ξ 36 quis Q. Catulum, humanitate, sapientia, integri-
tate antecellentem, a Cn. Manlio (superarev posse arbitratus est)?;

time A. U. 650=1³.c. 104. summa. 111 tamma nato] The Lutatz'a

was C. Lutatius Catulus cos. B.C. 242, the last year of the first
Punic war. It included several familiae ; those we know of are the
Catuli, Cercones, and Plinthiae.

ξ 32 l. 27.

C. Serranum] Gaius Atilius Serranus, cos. B.c. 106, the year
of Cicero and Pompey’s birth (Aul. Geli. xv 28). He was one of the
senators who took up arms against Saturninus B.c. 100 (or. p. Rabir.
§21). The Atilia gens was both patrician and plebeian. The first
member of it who obtained the consulship was M. Atilius Regulus in
13.C. 335. See n. to or. p. Sest. §72
