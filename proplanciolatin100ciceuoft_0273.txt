of the first council of Chalcedon), which Angelo Mai discovered had
been made up from ancient Mss of Symmachus' s eeches, M. C.
Fronto, Plinii Panegyricus and fragments o the four lost
speeches of Cicero in Clodium et Curionem, de aere alieno Milonis, de
rege Alexandrino, together with an old and valuable Commentary on
these and on the four extant speeches proArclzz'a, pro Sulla, pro Plancio
and iu Vatinium. But a further discovery awaited him, for upon his
return to Rome he detected in the Vatican a palimpsest, which evidently
formed the first part os that very MS of which the Ambrosian library
contained the second, ending in the speech pro Plancio with the word
adversus ch. lx § 22, while the Milan MS begins with the word T uscula-
nos (see notes p. 73). The MS was judged by Mai to be of the fourth
or fifth century. Part of these Scholia Bobiensia, as he called
them, was published by him at Milan in 1814 and the complete MS
in 1817. The commentary is imperfect1 and, so far as this speech is
concerned, the text of some passages only of it is quoted for illustration
and explanation. There is no doubt that the Ambrosian palimpsest is
not only older than any known Mss, but derived from a better and more
trustworthy original.

[This edition contains the whole of the excellent commentary of Garatoni re-
printed from the ninth volume of his edition of Cicero’s works, Napies, 1786, and
from his Curae secundae published aster a collation by J. C. Harless os the valuable
Tegernsee MS. It fully deserves the praises which the eminent Dutch scholar J. Bake
bestows upon it in his review in the Bibliotheca Critica Nova Tom. 111. p. 57—p.
88, where e writes :——‘ Garatonii rationem interpretandi satis praedicare non possum:
