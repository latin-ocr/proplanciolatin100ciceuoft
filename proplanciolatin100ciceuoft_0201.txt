1. 25. eductus ad eonsules] ‘brought before the consuls,’ the
technical expression, as appears from Verr. 11 2 26 § 63 quisquis erat
eductus senator Syracusanus, duci iubebat Asatellus, i. e. ‘any senator
Heraclius brought before Metellus, he (Metellus) ordered to be taken to
prison,’ ib. 37 ἓ 90 Sthenium statim educunt, ib. 3, 23ἓ 56 ad istum
in ius eductus est, edict. praet. ap. A. Gell. n. a. XI 17 ξ 2 quiflu-
mina retanda publice redempta habent, si quis eorum acl me eductus
fuerit. “

1. 26. motatum] ‘jostled‚' ‘roughly handled‚' ‘bullied‚' cf. ἓ 17
l. 30, ep. ad fam. 1 5b§ 1 posteaquam Pompeius apud populmn...cla-
more convicioque iactatus est, div. in Caec. ξ 45 te omni ratione
iactaturus, Plaut. Trin. 111 2, 59 nolo te iactari diutius, ‘I won’t
have you worry yourself any more.’

1. 28. cur non—anqutd—praeiudiefl comparasti] ‘ why did you not
secure, as you would have done had you convicted him, some recorded
verdict‚ some preceding sentence (as a presumptive proof of Plancius’
complicity)‚ sor the present trial?’ The meaning of praeiudicium is
clear from the following passages : div. in Caec. ἓ 12 de quo non
praeiudicium, sed plane 2·u.<2'z‘cz'um iam sactum putatur, or. p. Cluent.
ξ 59 apud eosdem iudices reus est factus, cum lzz‘s duobus praeiudiciis
iam damnatus esset, ib. ξ 60 qm' ceteros nullo praeiudicio sacto tamen
ex ῥύπα causa condemnassent, ἓ 62 condemnari ab iisdem iudicibus, qui
duo praeiudicia fecissent.

On the genitive of divided indefinite whole after aliquid see Madv.
Gr. ἓ 285 b, Zumpt Gr. ἓ 432, Roby Gr. 11 ἓ 1296 (b). ‘ Probat ipsum
adversarium iudicasse, nihil omnino suspicionis esse, quod in Plancium
posset oboriri ex persona eius, qui divisor fuisse videatur, quoniam eun-
dem neque reum fecerit neque ullam vel tenuem probationem habere
adversus eum potuerit3 quo damnato sine dubio consequenter videretur
de' Plancio iudicatum.’ SCHOL. VATIC.

ἓξ 55—5‘1. But it is plain enough that in prosecuting Plancius you
rely on something more than these facts : you rely upon your general
influence and name to crush Plancius, who has many personal enemies
and detractors: and there are always plenty of men ready to give
evidence in cases of ambitus. Cicero entreats the iudices to undertake
the business of eroes-examining these witnesses and to relieve his own
modesty from the unpleasant task, seeing they were his friends, and not
to give any heed to idle reports about the defendant.

1. 29. neque tu haee habes neque eis confidis] ‘ you neither know
these things as facts, nor do you rely on them‚' as likely to ensure the
condemnation of Plancius. On this sense of habere cf. or. in Pis. ἓ 5 3
habes reditum meum, or. in Verr. 11 5 ξ 25 habetis hominis consilia,
or. p. Flacco ξ 48 habetis honestatem hominis, ἓ 132 babes quod ex
me quaesisti, or. p. reg. Deiot.§ 21 habes crimina insidiarum. So in
English ‘to have:’ Shakesp. Henry V111 v 5, 15, when he has so
much English, Hamlet 11 1, 68 you have me; have you not? Merch.
