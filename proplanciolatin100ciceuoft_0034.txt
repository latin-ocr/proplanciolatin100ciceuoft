Another provision of the lex Tullia was that the accused
should not be allowed to deser or adjourn the trial on the plea
of illness, but that it should be continued without interruption
until terminated110.

ξ 18. The lex Tullia, however, was not more efficacious in
quelling the spirit of corruption than any previous enactments.
We still hear of large sums being spent upon elections. Cicero
in one of his letters to Atticus111 mentions two decrees of the
senate being passed‘in Β. C. 61, at the instance of M. Cato and
Domitius, to check certain electioneering abuses; one autho-
rising search of the houses of magistrates who were suspected
of having bribery money deposited with them ; another ordain-
ing that any magistrate, in whose house bribery agents were
harboured, should be held guilty of a state offence. There is
mention in the same letter of a bill proposed by the tr. pl.
Aufidius Lurco, that the mere promise of money to the
tribes for their votes without payment should not be punish-
able, but that the actual payment of it should be punished by a
heavy fine112. The proposed bill, however, was not passed.

These enactments of the lex Tullia and the two senatus
consulta of the year Β. C. 61 were still in full force, when Cicero
delivered his speech in favour of Plancius. It is of them he
speaks in §44113, and Laterensis also referred to them in his
indictment.

ἓ 19. A second mode of ambitus was by means of clubs or
associations (sodalz'cia). Gnaeus Plancius was charged by
M. Juventius Laterensis with having procured his aedileship
through the intrigues of such associations. Cicero's obJect is to
prove that the charges brought against his client were in reality
