relating to elections under certain conditions‚ viz. to establish
corffusz'o szgffi‘a‘grz’arum106 or ‘mass-voting‚' as a means of pre-
venting bribery, whenever a fresh election took place in con-
sequence of an elected magistrate having been convicted of
ambitus. Sulpicius also proposed a change in the method of
Judicial procedure: we hear now for the first time of iudices
editicii to try cases of bribery, his proposal being that there

should be 125 jurors nominated (editi) by the accuser out of

the decuriae of equites and aerarii tribuni, of which the Ι

defendant might challenge (reicere) 75, leaving 50, so that there
should be a jury of 75 in all, including 25 senators who were

to be appointed in some other way107. These proposals, how-
ever, of Sulpicius were not carried ; but the bill proposed by
Cicero (lex Tullia de ambitu), occasioned by the electoral
corruption of the preceding year, was more successful. It was
supplementary to the lex Acilia Calpurniam, defining the
proofs of guilt more closely and adding to penalties fixed by it
in the case of senatorial candidates ten years exile. It also
forbade certain practices tending to influence the electors un-
duly even when money was not offered, such as the presence of
crowds of hired attendants (deductores and sectatores). It
seems also to have imposed penalties on the dz’vzzvores109. It
also forbade ‘treating,’ as no person was allowed to exhibit
gladiatorial shows or give public payments within two years
before he was a candidate, except under the peculiar circum-
stances of its being required by a testamentary disposition102.

votes should not be given by tribus

that a majority of all the votes

have helped very much to check
bribery, for as each centuria had
a vote, which vote was determined
by a majority in the centuria, it
