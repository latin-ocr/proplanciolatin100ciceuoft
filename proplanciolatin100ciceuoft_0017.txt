preservation of the state was due to Cicero alone. F inally the
lex Cornelia de restituendo Cicerone passed the comitia centu-
riata1⁷ on the fourth of August, the Italian voters being especially
enthusiastic in the cause. On the fifth Cicero reached Brun-

while he was* still there, he was informed of the enactment

fourth of September, in the eighteenth month of his exile. On
the fifth he thanked the senate for what they had done in a
