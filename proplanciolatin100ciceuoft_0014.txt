destruction of the established social order. Clodius' first object
was to gain the favour of the people, which he did by enacting
laws³ that flattered thern and by appearing in the light of their
benefactor. He then began his attack on Cicero by proposing
a rogatio, that if any man had caused a Roman citizen to be
put to death without a regular hearing and formal sentence
he should be outlawed⁴3 and introduced into his bill a prohi-

repealing the law. This rogatio, which without expressly

with surprise and grief, that he immediately laid aside his
senatorial dress and went about in the equestrian habit, so-
liciting all who had influence‚ both friends and enemies. The
equites sent a deputation to the consuls and the senate on his
behalf 3 the senate passed a resolution to put on mourning, as
an expression of their sorrow for him, but were forbidden by an
edict of the consuls to do so⁵. Abandoned by the nobles and

from the coming storm. But his nature was little suited to
deeds of strife and violence: accordingly he succumbed to his
enemies and quitted Rome, ,before sentence was pronounced
against him, at the end of March. On the same day Clodius
carried his bill, having filled the forum with his gang of armed
slaves and mercenarieS. The edict was so far modified that
the ban was to extend only to a distance of four hundred
milesss. Cicero's object was to repair to Sicily or Malta, for
these islands, Sicily in particular, had been long devoted to
