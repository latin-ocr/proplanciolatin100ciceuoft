nomine sum Dyrrhachi (ab Thessalonica) hoc tempore (Nov. 30th),
ut quam celerrume quid agatur audiam ‚· et sum tuto: civitas enim haec
semper a me defensa est. On his former visit he had not thought of going
to Thessalonica, but to Cyzicus (per Macedoniam Cyzicum petebamus ib.
4 ξ 3, nobis iter est in Asiam, maxime Cyzicum ep. ad Att. 111 4, dated
April 19th‚ the very day of his arrival at Brundisium), his object being
to get as far as possible from Rome.

§ 98, 1. 4. refertam—sceleratissimorum hominum] For the
genitive after refertam cf. or. de imp. Cn. Pomp. §31 referto prae-
donum mari, or. p. Font. ἓ 11 referta Gallia negotiatorum est,
and see Madvig Gr. ἓ 268 a obs. 1, Roby Gr. ΙΙ ἓ 1336. These were
the reliquiae of the conspirators who had fied and dispersed themselves
through Greece because of Cicero's proceedings.

off ’ and therefore might easily hear of his arrival.

one.

The official residence of the governor of the province (which was always
