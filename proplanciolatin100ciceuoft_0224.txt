1. 24. opimium] L. Opimius, who as consul in Rc. 121 with
Q. Fabius Maximus Allobrogicus (Brut. ἕ 287) took the lead in the
proceedings which ended in the murder of Gaius Gracchus, Philipp. VIII
14, Cat. 1 54, or. part. 30, 104, 106. In B.C. 120 he was accused by
Q. Decius, tribune of the plebs, of having put Roman citizens to death
without a trial, defended by the consul C, Papirius Carbo (qui nilzil dc
C. Gracchi nece negabat sed ia’ iure pro salute patriae factum esse dicebat,
de or. 11 §106) and acquitted. He was condemned however 11 years
afterwards under the bill of C. Mamilius Limetanus sor enquiring into
the conduct of all those who had received bribes from Jugurtha (he had
been sent with others to divide the‘dominions of Micipsa between Ju-
gurtha and Adherbal), and went into exile to Dyrrhachium, where he
died (SCHOL. ΒΟΒ. p. 311, or. in Pis. §95, or. p. Sest. ἕ 140, de orat. II
§106, or. in Cat. 11 ἓ 4). Cic„ as a member of the optimate party,
frequently laments the fate of Opimius (or. p. Sest. ἓ 140), but unde-
servedly‚ for he and his party abused their victory most savagely. Ac·
cording to Mommsen he was the true model of a Roman aristocrat. See
