CHAPTER V

The grounds upon which Plancius was chosen rather than Laterensis
put into the mouth of the public. Laterensis had been too remiss in
his canvass, relying on the pride of his birth: but he is not the onl'y
instance of men of high family pretensions having been defeated in a

- popular election by men of mean extraction and even of inferior ability.

Moreover he went as quaestor to Cyrene, thus keeping away from
Rome when his services were much needed: and gave up his canvass
for the tribunate of the plebs at a great political crisis, which raised
doubts as to his public spirit or capacity. If he wishes to serve the
state, he may still be aedile, even if he take no pains about his canvass,
but if he aspires as he ought to do to* the higher state offices, he must
take more trouble than he has hitherto done to obtain the popular vote
by ingratiating himself with his electors (ἓξ 12—14).

parus] ‘the role’ which the people has played. In the next clause
observe the position of illius, to give it greater emphasis.
