centuria praerogativa] ‘the century to which it fell by lot to vote
first in the comitia.' Its vote was looked upon as aii indication of the
will of heaven (praerogativam maiores omen—comitiorum esse voluerunt,
de div. 1 545), ancl as such, was followed in elections at least by a
majority of the centuries‚ cf. Liv. XXVI 22, 2. Ramsay R. A. p. 1¹9·

1. 4. ut nemo umquam eam tulerit cet] ‘that no one has ever
carried it, i. e. been voted for by it, without afterwards being declared
duly elected the first of the two consuls either at that very election‚ or
if not, at all events for the current year.’

priorem, praetorem primum cunctis suffragiis pop. Rom. faciebat,
or. p. Mur. ξ 35 in praeturae petitione prior renunciatus est.

1. 6. in fllum annum] i.e. the current year, for which the com³tia
for the electiori of consuls was held. If the vote of the praerogativa
had such influence in determining the electiori to the consulate, can
Laterensis be surprised at Plancius' electiori to the aedileship, when he
had the praerogativa not merely of the part of a tribe, but of the whole
comitia, ι’. e. when his prior electiori made his second electiori certain ?

1. 7. 111 quo] ‘iri whose case‚’ ‘when in his case‚' ari adjectival
causal clause, Kenn. Gr. p. 451. Observe that Cic. speaks of the cen-
turia praerogativa as exignus pars populi opposed to populus zcnz'vm‘sus ;
and as unius tribus pars in opposition to tribus omnes or tota comitia.
