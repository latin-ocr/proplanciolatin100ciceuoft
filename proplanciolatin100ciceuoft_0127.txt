1.13. aedues—parati] ‘no matter who are aediles, the same
games and shows are provided sor me. ’ The ludi plebeii were conducted
by the plebeian aediles (Liv.XXX1 50), and were held on the 16th,17th
and 18th os November. The celebration of the ludi magni or Ro-
mani, the ludi scenici and the Megalenses belonged especially
to the curule aediles. On the origin of the aediles plebeii and the aediles
curules and their relative position, mode of election and duties, see
Ramsay Rom. Ant. p. 156 ff„ Dict. Antiq. p. 18 ff.

1. 15. redde mihi quod ostenderas] ‘sulfil the expectations you
had raised in me‚' viz. by becoming tribune. Cf. the phrase reddere
vota de leg. 11 ἓ 22, Verg. Ecl. v 75, and reddere promissa Aen.
v 386, and Brut ἓ 258 perge de Caesare et redde quae restant.

istam, sed amplissumos honores, praeturam et consulatum, quorum

plicaveris, non adipisceris. notum est autem quod Cicero de legg. 111

1. 19. condiscas censeo] ‘ I propose that you learn‚’ ‘ Ι advise you
to learn.’ When censeo is thus followed by a subjunctive clause with-
out ut, something of irony is generally implied. Cp. Phil. 11 ξ 95 quid
sis acturus meditere censeo, Verr. V ἓ 147 magno opere censeo desistas,
Sall. Cat. 52, 26 misereamini censeo.

CHAPTER VI

But, whatever the people may say in its own justification, the court
does not sit to enquire into the ground of the rejection of a candidate,
provided no bribery can be proved to have been employed against him.
We must take things as they are. The electors are free agents, not
bound to consider a man's family or any other pretensions, and, popular
feeling being so liable to fluctuation‚ how can the result of an electiori
be predicted with any certainty? (ἓὲ 14—16).

5 14, 1. 21. non debere iudicem quaerere] ‘that it is not the
province of the judex to investigate the grounds of your defeat) The

sorward why men should become humble suitors for popular favour.’
