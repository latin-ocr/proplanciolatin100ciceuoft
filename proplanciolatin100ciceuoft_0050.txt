Cicero obtained his client's acquittal. But we have no ancient
authority for this assertion. There is the evidenoe indeed of
Cicero himself in two letters addressed to him 1⁰⁶4'fflat he was
living at Corcyra, in B.C. 46 and it is assumed‘' that he was
living there in exile because of Caesar⁷s enmity towards him as
a partisan of Cn. Pompeius3 but this is mere assumption, as
there is nothing to show why Cn. Plancius was lifing out of
Italy, whether in consequence of his conviction or sor other
reasons.
