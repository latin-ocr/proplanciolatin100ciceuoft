§¹75‚ 1. 7. clamitas]‘ you bawl out‚' ἓ 381. 4, a slur upon Lateren-
sis' style of speaking, cf. de or. 11 20 '586‚ 111 21 ξ8ῐ, clamatores
odmsi et molesti, Brut. §182 ut intellegi possit, quem existimem clama-
torem, quem oratorem.

commovere studes, ut ea propter reos absolvant. w.

1. 8. mhi] in cispio profee1st1]‘you derived no advantage from talk-
ing in this way in the case ofCispius.' M. Cispius was tribune ofthe plebs
in B.C. 57, the year of Cicero’s restoration from exile, when he took an
active part in Cicero's favour, and on one occasion risked his life (or. p.
Sest. ἓ 76) sor him. In return for these services he was defended by
Cic. when prosecuted for ambitus, but convicted in spite of his advo—
cate’s eloquence and tears. Cf. or. p. red. in S.§ 21 quid M. Cispius?
cui ego ipsi, parenti fratrique eius sentio quantum debeam .· · qui, cum a
me voluntas eorum in privato iudicio esset qffmsa, publici mei bem-’ficii
memoria privatam cffmsionem oblitterammt‚ or. p. Sest. ἓ 76.

’ obsoletae] ‘worn out‚' ‘no longer of use.'

1. 9. quem— defendi] ‘whose desence I undertook by your persuasion,
just as it was from your testimony that 1 found out he had deserved so
well of me.' On eodem cf. ὅ 54 1. 14, de off. 1 §63, §84‚ and see Kenn.
Gr. p. 285, Madv. Gr. § 488.

1. 10. meritum] sc. esse.

1. 11. et ei dices cen] ‘and am Ι the man whom you will address
with the taunt quo usque,—1‚ whose exertions on Cispius’ behalf were,
you say, unavailing ?' e1=mihi tali and therefore contenderim not
‹ontenderit is the correct reading.

1. 12. nam istius verbi ceth] “for the import of your invidious
remark ‘ how much longer' possibly might be this ε ‘One man has been
given up to you ; another has been pardoned out of regard to you (spared
sor your sal<e); there is no end (to your begging off friends), we cannot
put up with it any longer. For when a. man has exerted himself for one
person in particular and has failed to obtain the very object of his
exertions, to have said to him ‘How much longer? this looks more like
ridicule than rebuke.' ’ 'lhe syllogism 1s: ei dici potest ‘Quousque' qui
obtinuit. At ego non obtinui. Mihi igitur dici non potest‘ Quousque.’
But, as Long observeS‚ Laterensis did not mean this. He meant to say:
⁴ How long will you continue this kind of desence, when you see that it
does no good to your clients ?'’ The sel-10L.AMBROS. have the follow·
ing note· ‘-—unde quo minus impudens videretur haec compensativa
defensio, dicente Laterense, quousque vis servatos esse quos di·
ligis? et pro Cispio causam dicente sic rogasti et pre·
cibus tuis ambitum paene movisti, opposuit acutissimam re—
sponsionem merito haec ab eo dici potuisse, si pro illo impetrasset.
