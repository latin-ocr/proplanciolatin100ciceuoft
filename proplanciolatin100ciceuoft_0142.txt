war as one of the refractory colonies which in ΕΟ. 209 refused any
further contributions, and afterwards it lapsed into the condition of an
ordinary municipal town. Juvenal (Sat. 111 223) speaks of it as a quiet
country town where good houses were cheap. It was situated in the
valley of the Liris about six miles north of Arpinum.

nemo casinas] ‘no inhabitant of Casinum' (san Germano), the
last town of Latium on the via Latina (Strabo V. p. 237), about five miles
from the lower bank of the Liris. It was wrested from the Samnites
and in B.C. 3¹² a Roman colony was sent there, Liv. IX 28. Livy
(XXII 13) tells how Hannibal intended occupying it to prevent the con-
sul Fabius from advancing on Campania, but was led by a mistake of
his guide to Casilinum. Silius Italicus (bell. pun. XII 527) speaks of
itss rin s:—

p g nymphisque habitata Casinis

rura evastantur,

and of its foggy climate (IX 227) :—
et nebulosi rura C asin i.

It became a flourishing and opulent municipal town under the republic
and under the empire. On the hill above it is the celebrated monastery
of Monte Cassino, founded by St Benedict A. D. 529: and close to it
are the remains of a small but perfect amphitheatre built at the private
expense of Ummidia Quadratilla, of whom Pliny (ep. VII 24) gives an
account.

Aquinas] ‘inhabitant of Aquinum ’ (Aquino), a Volscian town on
the via Latina between Fabrateria and Casinum, near the Liris, the
birth-place of Juvenal (Juv. Sat. III 318-9 quotiens-² e Roma tuo refici
properantem reddet A quino). It was a populous place (frequens mu-
nicipium II Phil. ἓ 106, μεγάλη πόλις Strabo v p. 2 37, ingens Aquinum,
Sil. It. VIII 405). Cicero had a villa there (ep. ad fam. IX ‘²4 ἕ I).

1. 26. celeberrimus] ‘very populous‚’ ‘much frequented,' the pri-
mary and only meaning of the word in Cicero, who does not use it in the
sense of ‘renowned,’ or. p. Arch. §4 celebri urbe et copiosa, where

town of Campania, situated on a hill above the valley of the Vulturnus
and on the via Latina, sixteen miles from Casinum. Its oil was cele-
brated as the best in Italy <Juv. Sat. V 86, Hor. Sat. 11 4, 69, 8, 45,
Od. ΙΙ 6, 15, Varr. r. r. I 2 ἓ 6 quoa’ vinum (conferam) Falerno? quod
oleum Venafro? Plin. hist. nat. XV 2 s. 3). Its territory was one of
those which the tribune Rullus proposed by his agrarian law to divide
among the Roman citizens, cp. or. de leg. agr. 11 ἓ 66. See Dict. Geogr. ·
11 p. 1270.

Allifanus] of Allifae (Ali e), a city of Samnium (Strabo p. 238,
Liv. VIII 25, XXII 18) in the valley of the Vulturnus, at the soot

brated for the manufacture of large drinking-vessels, Hor. Sat. ΙΙ 8, 39
